In Gimlet Media's recent 'Startup' podcast, they deconstructed the making of a single episode. Each one is highly-produced, and assembled from extensive research, multiple interviews, and carefully scripted.


Story-telling and neuroscience. Two of my favourite things - in one experiment. Put a pair of people in separate brain scanners, and have one tell the other a story. Their brain activity starts to sync up, as though the story-teller is puppeteering the listener's brain-strings.

Stories are unfairly powerful as devices for controlling attention, perception, memory and belief. Attentionally, the temporal direction keeps us angling for the next step. Perceptually, the story plays out in our Cartesian theatre. Mnemonically, the narrative provides a skeleton that cues and holds the pieces together. And perhaps for all these reasons, the story seems to live in our head - or perhaps we live in it. And so a story is attention-grabbing, vivid, memorable, and persuasive.
