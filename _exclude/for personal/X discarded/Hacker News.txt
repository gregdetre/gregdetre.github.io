I used to live on Hacker News. They were my people.
Programmers, startup founders and scientists.
They were well-informed, insightful and shared my interests.
Sadly, there is a flip-side to this personality type.
They can be acidic, embittered and small-minded.
Perhaps all glows are only visible in the rear view mirror,
and all communities are only visibly special when they've changed.
Certainly this is [not a new complaint](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4396747).

I have rarely had something I've built lauded on HN,
rarely been able to write a headline that baits clicks,
rarely had a post I've written garner more than a few points,
and never felt on the inside.
That said, I don't think I can ever predict what a group larger than a few friends round a table will think.
So maybe the problem lies with me or my expectations or sense of entitlement.
