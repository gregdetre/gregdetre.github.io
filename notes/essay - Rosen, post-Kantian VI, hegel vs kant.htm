VI - Dr Rosen, Lincoln</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel saw Kant as a precursor to his own philosophy, tracing
a path through the historicised pattern of ideas to the apprehension of reality
itself through the dialectic. Kant is an advance from the pre-Kantian
metaphysicians Hegel terms, �dogmatists�. Their na� attempts to grasp reality
were based on insufficient scepticism about their intellectual equipment, discussing
the Soul, the World and God without questioning the sharp delineations of the
finite and infinite that they employed. With Kant�s metaphysics of the
understanding came consideration about the validity of the Dogmatists� �title
to fixity and truth�, and ultimately ushered in the Hegelian speculative truth
which holds opposing fomulae �in union as a totality�. Hegel commends Kant in
terms which appear in direct contrast to Kant�s stated aims of combating
scepticism and accepting certain forms of thinking uncritically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the face of it, Kant and Hegel are very different
philosophers. Yet Hegel owes a very great deal to Kant, and indeed offers some
very careful analysis of his writings, mainly contained in <i>Faith and
Knowledge</i>, the <i>Lesser Logic</i> and the <i>Lectures on the History of
Philosophy</i>. I am going to group these differences, and criticisms, into
five major areas:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>reason and the dialectic;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the world in-itself and
subjectivism;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the categories;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>morality; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul Guyere sees Kant�s indispensable contribution to the
progress of philosophy in recognising that the most basic principles of human
thought reflect the structure of our own minds. Hegel sees himself as adding
the final step, which consisted in realising the identity between the nature of
reality and human thought. Kant saw that we could not have both necessary and
empirical knowledge, that we could either know what is necessary a priori, or
learn contingent and particular truths through experience. His acceptance of
this impassable gulf was based on Hume. Guyere accuses him of trying to avail
himself of the Kantian claims to a priori knowledge in order to apply them
beyond the scope of human representation to which Kant saw they are limited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Thought must investigate its own capacity for knowledge�
(LL 67 z). The pre-Kantians failed to examine their presuppositions, and so
were not �free thinkers�. The categories must be examined, which Kant attempts
prior to or independently of their exercise. Rather, Hegel holds that their
limitations will be revealed in their use, a much more pragmatic theory of
knowledge. This revision and enrichment in use is what Hegel terms the
�dialectic�, acculumating truth by reflecting on the inadequacy of concepts in
their use. That Hegel thinks he can see much further than Kant rests on his use
of the dialectic, or speculative reason. Hegel thinks that knowledge as Kant
sets it out is not knowledge at all, not �truths�, but only �phenomena�, the
world as it appears to us rather than as it is. The �only objectivity Kant
allows is provided by the categories, but that these in turn are subjective
because �psychological�� (Priest). Without dialectic, Kant�s reason can only
produce the imaginary; reason for Kant is just the understanding considered in
abstraction from its only legitimate subject matter (FK 80, W ii 317). By
employing the dialectic, Hegel opens up an enormous vista of knowledge about
reality that before could be accessed only a posteriori in the form of
contingent, particular truths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Hegel offers no explanation of how to justify
necessary truth without controverting Kant�s analysis of the limitations of the
intellect. Guyere concedes that Hegel may be correct in the basic point that
the necessary truths Kant holds up may well themselves be radically contingent.
While Kant goes some way towards recognising this as an inherent limitation of
human cognition, Hegel sees it as a sign that Kant�s philosophy will ultimately
become a superceded period in the history of philosophy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand why else Hegel regards knowledge in a
Kantian system as unnecessarily limited and narrow relative to his, we need to
look at what Kant termed the �conditions for experience�:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt;mso-outline-level:1'><i>The
�transcendental unity of self-consciousness�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>This is Kant�s means of
identifying �I�, as having the condition of a set of experiences being episodes
in the self-same consciousness that is �mine�. Hegel seems to reify this
misleadingly as the Ego, despite Kant�s refusal to make any<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>ontological commitments</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-outline-level:1'><i>�Space and
time�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Space and time are the way or manner
in which persons perceive, the �universal type of perception�. However, they
are <i>a priori</i>, since they are not derived or abstracted from experience
so much as they contribute to and shape it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-outline-level:1'><i>The �manifold
of sensation�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Hegel defines an object �<i>x</i>� in
terms of how it can be differentiated from all that is not-x. This is what he
means by things having their �being outside themselves�. This is contrasted
with the Ego, which has no non-Ego or other-Ego, and so constitutes the
undifferentiated �primary identity�, or <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Geist</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because Kant defines �I� psychologistically as being just
the �transcendental unity of self-consciousness� instead of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Geist</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>, he </span>irretrievably divorces his metaphysics from Hegelian
absolute knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kant�s system can never yield Absolute Knowing for a further
reason related to the categories. Hegel rejects Kant�s claim that the
categories are empty when considered in abstraction from their empirical
applications. Hegel argues that they have content even though it is undetectable
in sense experience, since they can be discriminated between semantically, that
is to say, non-empirically (Priest). However, Hegel allows that the categories
could be seen as empty in a Hegelian sense, insofar as the Absolute is not
given in perception so understanding by means of the categories cannot be of
the things-in-themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel�s use of �categories� is different from Kant�s in
three major ways:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt;mso-outline-level:1'>There are
many more than twelve</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>They are changing and
developing, rather than ahistorically fixed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>They apply directly to reality.
They cannot be said to apply to things-in-themselves, because Hegel rejects the
entire distinction between the worlds of appearances and in-itself on two
grounds: incoherence and a psychological construct. He regards the idea of
things-in-themselves as defined only by their existence as incoherent, since
there is no sortal by which they can be described, i.e. no not-<i>x</i> against
which they can be contrasted and thus defined. The in-itself is also a
psychological construct insofar as it is a reality as shaped by us, by our
concepts and categories. Hegel is ambiguous as to whether there are no
things-in-themselves or whether there are things-in-themselves but we can have
knowledge of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although �Kant was the first definitely to signalise the
distinction between reason and understanding� (LL 73 z), his �drastic
underestimation of reason is partly due to an impoverished concept of infinity�
(Priest). Kant considers infinity as contrasted with finitude, whereas Hegel
sees true infinity as the synthesis of finitude and infinite, that is the
whole. This whole is the �universal divine Idea�, the ground of the finite
objects, and for and on which human subjects are finite points of view. This is
Absolute, rather than subjective, idealism. To Hegel, there is no world as it
appears-to-us and world as it is in-itself, but rather a whole of which both
subjects and objects are manifestations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is why Hegel agrees with Kant�s disassembly of the
�soul-thing� into the formal �I� as simply the �unity of self-consciousness�,
though he doesn�t see this as a significant advance over Hume. Hegel�s own
understanding of the self-conscious subject is as �reality�s points of view on
itself� (Priest), as aspects of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Geist</i>�s
consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Antinomies are lauded insofar as they consider
contradictions, but attacked for their limited employment. Hegel considers
there to be far more than just four � indeed, �Antinomies appear in all objects
of every kind, in all conceptions, notions and ideas� (LL 78). Indeed, �the
world� (LL 77, der Welt) is itself paradoxical � it contains contradictions.
�Contradictions� in this sense should not be taken in the sense of <i>p</i> and
not-<i>p</i>, but as antithetical notions such as freedom and necessity, or
subject and object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel attacks the Categorical Imperative as being an
entirely formal principle of universalisation, and thus empty, since it can be
satisfied by actions that would be consistent if everyone were to adopt them as
their maxim, without their necessarily being <i>good</i>. Being �good� is
defined vacuously in terms of duty, and so Kant�s ethics do not on their own
tell us in any way how we ought to act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Apparently, Kant would have asked himself the question �What
is the final end of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>whole</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>�, had he thought through his teleology. The
answer is �the Good�, requiring God for its realisation. This realisation is
the Idea�s dialectical progress through history. While �Hegel�s God postulates
the existence of God for the realisation of his cosmic ideals�, in contrast, Kant
�postulates the existence of God for the realisation of human ethical goals�
(Priest).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of ways in which Hegel sees that Kantian
philosophy might be almost Hegelian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel identifies �reflecting judgement� with �intuitive
understanding� in Kant�s system. This is the faculty by which �the particulars
[are] � moulded and formed by the universal itself� (LL 88). Hegel sees this as
a close anticipation of the Idea. �In exhibiting the reciprocal dependence of
universal and particular, Kant�s philosophy shows itself capable of being
genuinely speculative (LL 88).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, Hegel�s discontent with Kant boils down to what
he failed to do. By relying on the understanding without employing speculative
reason, Kant made progress but did not discover the Hegelian system. In this
sense, Hegel sees Kant as being a forerunner that stopped short, defining Kant
in terms of the Hegelian rather than the other way round. Kant was forever
trapped in his own unsynthesised opposites, perhaps most importantly in terms
of the phenomenal-noumenal and a non-metaphysical world of appearances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel would certainly regard a large proportion of his
philosophy as resting on, and therefore a critique of, Kant. There are also
other influences who should not be forgotten, notably his contemporaries Fichte
and Schelling, but an enormous amount of Hegel�s thinking can be described
almost completely as a reaction to Kant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walsh concludes that the differences between Kant and Hegel
lie largely in details, although admittedly details of considerable importance.
For instance, Kant�s system of the categories is permanent, whereas Hegel�s is
apparently richer and subject to change. But overall, though Kant lacked the
imagination that Hegel applied boldly to his system, Kant might well have
written Hegel�s philosophy, other than �nonsense� which Hegel occasionally
lapses into. However, Walsh�s conclusion that Kant himself might have been a
Hegelian if he had had a little more imagination seems far-fetched. Hegel�s
critique of Kant does him so much violence that though Kant�s influence is
enormous, their two philosophies are quite divergent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel never judges Kant on his own terms. He shies away from
criticising Kant internally on the basis of unsound arguments, nor does he
examine Kant�s own reasons for his subjectivism, but sees it almost as �a
failure of nerve� (Guyer). We can understand why this is, since Hegel regards
his system as the culmination of the history of philosophy to which Kant
provides only the denouement. Kant�s philosophy is good in as much as it agrees
with Hegel�s own, can be assimilated into it or provides one half of a
thesis-antithesis pair. Methodologically, Hegel�s dependence on dialectic
places him at odds with most Kantian conclusions, since Hegel finds an
antithesis and synthesis in response to almost everything. Hegel pounces on
anything in Kant which might be interpreted as dialectical as an anticipation
of the future.</p>
