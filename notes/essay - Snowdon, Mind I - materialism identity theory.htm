<h1><a name="_Toc496675750">What version, if any, of the psycho-physical
Identity theory is acceptable? What reasons are there to believe such a view?</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Greg Detre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>@12 on

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Prof.
Snowdon</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Identity theory of mind can be understood simply as the
claim that every mental property is identical with some physical property, i.e.
every mental state or process is one and the same as a physical state or
process. Thus, the mind-body problem as considered by dualists collapses into
monism. To the best of contemporary scientific understanding, these physical
states and processes are localised as neurochemical activity in the brain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A dualist�s initial reaction to such a theory might be one
of stupefaction: how can the plainly non-physical, private phenomenology of the
mental be in any way akin to the physically deterministic, objective neural
activity of the squishy brain? It is important to note that Identity theorists
are not saying that mind and brain per se are identical or interchangeable
terms, but rather that mental experiences just <i>are</i> brain processes (an
even stronger claim than being merely correlated with each other).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart played a role in the group which first outlined
psychophysical Identity theory in the 1950s, along with Feigl and Place. He
distinguishes himself from the central state materialists, for whom �mental
states are actual brain states�, as well as dualists, �nomological danglers�
and �excrescences on the fair face of science�. Rather, as Lewis and others
after him, he sees himself as a physicalist, looking for explanation in terms
of physical laws, though which may admit non-material entities. He takes pains
to specify that his brand of physicalism is ontological, rather than
translational (i.e. word-for-word).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This original formulation of Identity theory holds that
mental and brain processes are extensionally identical, but intensionally
different in terms of how we perceive, identify and refor to them. Smart draws
attention to the example often used to distinguish meaning and reference of
Hesperus vs Phosphorus, or the Morning Star and Evening Star. Only relatively
recently has it become apparent that Hesperus and Phosphorus are one and the
same astronomical object, simply seen at different times of the day and in
different parts of the sky. Thus our reference, (i.e. the names we use � <i>intensional</i>)
draw a false distinction between two ways of seeing the same object (<i>extensional</i>).
The mind and brain are to be seen in a similar way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lewis (1966) elaborates an argument for the Identity theory
by analysing what we mean by �experience�. He takes as his crucial premise that
�the definitive characteristic of an experience � is its causal role [in our
actions]�. He takes as his second major presmise the physicalist<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>
one that our causal role is in fact played by physical (i.e. neural)
states/processes. Therefore, since the definitive characteristic of experience
is played by physical states/processes, experience must be physical. If one
accepts the two premises, one must accept the conclusion. But those two premises
leave plenty of room for contention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lewis is really making use of Leibniz�s Law of Identity,
which holds that two objects are identical if they share exactly the same
properties. If this cannot be said of mind and brain, then the proponents of
the Identity theory are committing a �category error�. Lewis� argument pivots
around the definitive characteristic of experience being solely its causal
role. But what if we can point to other characteristics of the mental, without
which an experience wouldn�t <i>be</i> an experience?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For instance, though the brain is extended (in the
philosophical sense of being physically located, and taking up space), whereas
mind appears not to be. It seems somewhat nonsensical to say that there is a
thought in the car park, say � rather, thoughts can be localised in terms of
the self to whom they occurred. We have to be careful at this point not to
allow the correct use of language to too strongly colour our analysis.
Copernicus� statement that the earth moves around the sun was described
scornfully as an �abuse of language�, because �movement� is by definition
relative to the earth, so to speak of movement <i>of</i> the earth is to play
games with words. Defining reality by reference to how we describe it
linguistically, if that is indeed what we are doing, would be a mistake. But
perhaps we can move the debate to firmer ground by considering another property
of the mental that seems fundamentally at odds with the physical, its
subjectiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel gives us powerful ammunition to use against those who
seek to downplay the importance of phenomenological subjectivity in the mental,
as Lewis does by defining experiences in terms of their causal role alone. In
�What is it like to be a bat?�, he attacks the Identity theorists� methodology,
of regarding the mind-body problem as simply a modern example of problems like
the water-H<sub>2</sub>O problem, which have fallen to intertheoretic reduction
and the scientific method. Nagel is most concerned with the Identity theorists�
treatment (or failure to treat) what he calls the �subjective character of
experience�. He is referring to the way that everyone�s experiences are
subjective to them (as best we can tell, given our own subjective view on the
matter). We cannot understand what it is like to be a bat � only a bat can. If
we try and imagine, then at best we can conceive what it would be like <i>for
us</i> to be a bat. It is this privacy of the mental which makes a
reconciliation between an objective, scientific, physicalist understanding and
our individual, incommunicably subjective perspectives so problematic, as Nagel
rightly argues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, I see the shortcomings of the Identity theories
more particularly in terms of the peculiar, non-physical, vivid, indescribable,
irreducible quality and sensation <i>to the (human) conscious experiencer </i>of
experience which <i>is</i> experience. To ignore this aspect of the mental,
call it the subjective character of experience, �qualia� or phenomenology, is
to ignore the mental. The problems facing natural philosophers about
soundwaves, heat, colour and the like all concern separate sensory modalities
whose physical principles <i>and</i> physiology we now understand. But we don�t
understand any better why a noise <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sounds</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> the</span> way it does or why a fire <i>feels</i>
hot. To say that we undestand them by virtue of the reductionist�s scalpel is
to answer �How can we understand and predict this physical phenomenon?�, but
misses the difficult half of the original question, �And why does it feel like
this to me?�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can now challenge Lewis� premise that the defining
characteristic of experience is its causal role. Whether we choose to posit the
subjective phenomenological quality of experience as its defining
characteristic <i>as well as</i>, or <i>in place of</i> its causal role is a
separate question. A full account of experience would, I think, seem to need
both these characteristics: a subjective feeling of what that experience is
like, and causal interaction that allows experiences and thoughts (in the same
way that folk psychology attributes our actions to intentions, beliefs and
desires) to give rise to actions and other experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we were to try and rid experience of both its causal role
<i>and</i> its phenomenological quality, we would be left close to
behaviourism, where our actions can be seen as determined in a hugely complex
version of the stimulus-response paradigm, seeing humans much like zombies
(behaviourally and constitutionally identical to humans, but lacking
consciousness). Logical behaviourism places a veneer over classical
behaviourism, by arguing that we can impose intentions, desires and beliefs
onto others� actions as a means of making sense of others in an internal model,
but in fact these actions are still determined purely by (an albeit complex)
behaviourist model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, I want to discuss what the implications of
characterising experience <i>solely</i> by its subjective quality, and leaving
its causal role aside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the position we are left in if we deny Lewis� first
premise, but accept his second: that causality in our universe is determined by
laws of physics (including those beyond contemporary understanding of them). We
will try at this stage to leave deterministic physics its jurisdiction over the
workings of our universe. If this is the case, then the neural mechanism is
open to discovery by the scientific method, and explicable and predictable
according to universal physical laws. Given that we are taking Identity theory
to mean the neurochemical activity of the brain by �physical states and
processes�, Identity theory appears to be denying downward causation from mind
to brain. This is the critical issue that Davidson seeks to address with
anomalous monism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Davidson�s anomalous monism is a token Identity theory. By
that, we mean that he is identifying particular brain states/processes with
particular mental states/processes. Crucially, he does not seek to identify
types of processes (e.g. pain, or similar sensations) with each other. He takes
as premises the nomological character of causality (i.e. physical laws), the
anomalism of the mental (freedom from such deterministic laws) and causal
interaction between the mental and physical. Causal relations occur under
neural descriptions, but not under psychological descriptions because of the
indeterminacy of translation and interpretation that occurs between the neural
and psychological descriptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Davidson argues strongly that despite the apparent conflicts
between his premises, he is able to demonstrate a reconciliatory explanation.
However, Kim and others doubt the causal efficacy of the mental in such a
picture. For them, anomalous monism falls prey to the criticism of
epiphenomenalism. We have said that Lewis� Identity theory leaves little room
in its explanation of the mental for phenomenology, i.e. non-physical, private
events and states. Here, we have taken things to the opposite extremes,
allowing such an added dimension to the mental, but denying it the causal role
that we must as physicalists (since the brain obeys deterministic rules, how
could our thoughts be anything but spectators in our actions). Here, our
phenomenological experience is delegated to �epiphenomenon�, an evolutionarily
non-adaptive side-effect, perhaps of language or high-level cognitive processes
working within a rich internal representation of the world. In a weird kind of paradox,
the homonculus Dennett tries to exorcise from his controlling role in a<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Cartesian theatre of the mind is reinstated,
but more as the audience than as the playwright.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Identity theory avoids the problem of interaction between
mind and body by regarding them as simply interactions between subsets of
material states. To an Identity theorist, the secrets of the mind will fall to
neuroscience in the same way that the theory of electricity reveals the secrets
of lightning. However, how this will happen is left mysterious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel identifies parallels between pre-scientific notions of
his �a posteriori necessary truths� like water, lightning, sound and heat, and
current philosophy of mind. Such problems suffer from what he expressively
terms an �explanatory gap�, characterised by an ineliminable vagueness in our
discussions, because we have an inadequate conceptual toolbox for the problem.
Understanding sound in terms of soundwaves, or mind in terms of brain, involves
bridging two terminologies and levels of explanation which cannot initially be
explained or even imagined in terms of the other. Indeed, glossing over these
questions in the same fashion with mind is to gloss over the grand-daddy
question underlying them all. For all of these intertheoretic reductions are,
at their root, problems of mind, not matter. Understanding the physics of a
soundwave tells us nothing about the <i>noise</i> we hear. We cannot attempt
the same reductionist approach in philosophy of mind that worked on these
problems, because reductionism fails to explain (or often even recognise)
phenomenology. Phenomenology<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>
is the great problem in philosophy of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We know that mind and body appear inextricably related
causally, but it seems impossible to imagine how their seemingly irreconcilably
different properties can be identified with each other. Perhaps speculatively
though, if we come back to the crucial physicalist caveat, that the laws of our
universe are certainly more complicated than our current understanding of them,
then there may be room for some far-fetched seeming reconciliations of the
subjective quality and the causal role of experience that we discarded as being
in violation of deterministic physical laws. This is the approach that Nagel
tentatively points to (as in �Panpsychism�) and Penrose embraces through the
sub-atomic haziness of quantum mechanics. Such ideas are early attempts at
bridging the explanatory gap separating mind and body from both sides at once.</p>

essay, I will use the term physicalism as the view that all factual knowledge
can be stated in terms of physical objects and laws governing their
interactions. This is intended to be slightly looser than the way the term

through their interchangeable use.</p>

avoided the term, �consciousness�, because it is overly associated with human,
linguistic awareness of higher thought processes. This way, I hope to open up
the idea of phenomenology to easily accommodate a similar consideration of the
mental in animals.</p>
