<h1>Reading � Minsky, Will robots inherit the earth?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Greg Detre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Thursday,
July 04, 2002</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Franklin lived for 84 years and, except in popular legends
and myths, no one has ever lived twice that long. According to the estimates of
Roy Walford, professor of pathology at UCLA Medical School, the average human
life span was about 22 years in ancient Rome; about 50 in the developed
countries in 1900, and today stands at about 75. Still, each of those curves
seems to terminate sharply near 115 years. Centuries of improvements in health
care have had no effect on that maximum</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why are our life spans so limited? The answer is simple:
Natural selection favors the genes of those with the most descendants. Those
numbers tend to grow exponentially with the number of generations--and so this
favors the genes of those who reproduce at earlier ages. Evolution does not
usually favor genes that lengthen lives beyond that amount adults need to care
for their young. Indeed, it may even favor offspring who do not have to compete
with living parents. Such competition could promote the accumulation of genes
that cause death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, after spawning, the Mediterranean octopus (O.
Hummelincki) promptly stops eating and starves to death. If we remove a certain
gland though, the octopus continues to eat, and lives twice as long. Many other
animals are programmed to die soon after they cease reproducing. Exceptions to
this include those long-lived animals, like ourselves and the elephants, whose
progeny learn so much from the social transmission of accumulated knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>certain species (including some varieties of fish,
tortoises, and lobsters) do not appear to show any systematic increase of
mortality rate with age. These animals seem to die mainly from external causes,
such as predators or a lack of food. Still, we have no records of animals that
have lived for as long as 200 years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walford and many others believe that a carefully designed
diet, one seriously restricted in calories, can significantly increase a
human�s life span--but cannot prevent our ultimate death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>biological wearing out would still be a problem</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are merely clever pumps. Muscles and bones are motors and
beams. Digestive systems are chemical reactors</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we consider replacing a brain though, a transplant will
not work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we might be able to replace certain worn out parts of brains
by transplanting tissue-cultured fetal cells. This procedure would not restore
lost knowledge --but that might not matter as much as it seems. We probably
store each fragment of knowledge in several different places, in different
forms. New parts of the brain could be retrained and reintegrated with the rest
-- and some of that might even happen spontaneously</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brain, like other finite things, must reach some limits
to what it can learn. We don't know what those limits are; perhaps our brains
could keep learning for several more centuries. Ultimately, though, we will
need to increase their capacity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does this mean that machines will replace us? I don't feel
that it makes much sense to think in terms of &quot;us&quot; and
&quot;them.&quot; I much prefer the attitude of Hans Moravec of Carnegie-Mellon
University, who suggests that we think of those future intelligent machines as
our own &quot;mind- children.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, we would not need to know every minute detail.
If that were so, our brains wouldn't work in the first place. In biological
organisms, generally each system has evolved to be insensitive to most details
of what goes on in the smaller subsystems on which it depends. Therefore, to
copy a functional brain, it should suffice to replicate just enough of the
function of each part to produce its important effects on other parts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose that we wanted to copy a machine, such as a brain,
that contained a trillion components. Today we could not do such a thing (even
were we equipped with the necessary knowledge) if we had to build each
component separately. However, if we had a million construction machines that
could each build a thousand parts per second, our task would take only minutes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In none of these situations were people able to learn, and
later remember, more than about 2 bits per second, for any extended period. If
you could maintain that rate for twelve hours every day for 100 years, the
total would be about three billion bits -- less than what we can store today on
a regular 5-inch Compact Disk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite those popular legends about people with
'photographic memories,' no one seems to have mastered, word for word, the
contents of as few as one hundred books--or of a single major encyclopedia. The
complete works of Shakespeare come to about 130 million bits. Landauer's limit
implies that a person would need at least four years to memorize them. We have
no well-founded estimates of how much information we require to perform skills
such as painting or skiing, but I don't see any reason why these activities
shouldn't be similarly limited</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The brain is believed to contain the order of a hundred
trillion synapses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, we could design our &quot;mind-children&quot; to
think a million times faster than we do. To such a being, half a minute might
seem as long as one of our years, and each hour as long as an entire human
lifetime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>But could such beings really
exist? Many thinkers firmly maintain that machines will never have thoughts
like ours, because no matter how we build them, they'll always lack some vital
ingredient. They call this essence by various names--like sentience,
consciousness, spirit, or soul. Philosophers write entire books to prove that,
because of this deficiency, machines can never feel or understand the sorts of
things that people do. However, every proof in each of those books is flawed by
assuming, in one way or another, the thing that it purports to prove--the
existence of some magical spark that has no detectable properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many philosophers have declared that understanding (or
meaning, or consciousness) must be a basic, elemental ability that only a
living mind can possess. To me, this claim appears to be a symptom of
&quot;physics envy&quot;--that is, they are jealous of how well physical
science has explained so much in terms of so few principles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;If you understand something in only one way, then you
don't really understand it at all. This is because, if something goes wrong,
you get stuck with a thought that just sits in your mind with nowhere to go.
The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to
all the other things we know. This is why, when someone learns 'by rote,' we
say that they don't really understand. However, if you have several different
representations then, when one approach fails you can try another. Of course,
making too many indiscriminate connections will turn a mind to mush. But
well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to
envision things from many perspectives until you find one that works for you.
And that's what we mean by thinking!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to think effectively, you need multiple processes
to help you describe, predict, explain, abstract, and plan what your mind
should do next. The reason we can think so well is not because we house mysterious
spark-like talents and gifts, but because we employ societies of agencies that
work in concert to keep us from getting stuck. When we discover how these
societies work, we can put them to inside computers too. Then if one procedure
in a program gets stuck, another might suggest an alternative approach. If you
saw a machine do things like that, you'd certainly think it was conscious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was amazed to find that at least three quarters of the
audience seemed to feel that our life spans were already too long. &quot;Why
would anyone want to live for five hundred years? Wouldn't it be boring? What
if you outlived all your friends? What would you do with all that time?&quot;
they asked. It seemed as though they secretly feared that they did not deserve
to live so long. I find it rather worrisome that so many people are resigned to
die. Might not such people be dangerous, who feel that they do not have much to
lose? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My scientist friends showed few such concerns. &quot;There
are countless things that I want to find out, and so many problems I want to
solve, that I could use many centuries,&quot; they said. Certainly, immortality
would seem unattractive if it meant endless infirmity, debility, and dependency
upon others--but we're assuming a state of perfect health. Some people expressed
a sounder concern--that the old ones must die because young ones are needed to
weed out their worn-out ideas. However, if it's true, as I fear, that we are
approaching our intellectual limits, then that response is not a good answer.
We'd still be cut off from the larger ideas in those oceans of wisdom beyond
our grasp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our
children. We owe our minds to the deaths and lives of all the creatures that
were ever engaged in the struggle called Evolution. Our job is to see that all
this work shall not end up in meaningless waste. </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Many computers maintain unused copies of their most
critical &quot;system&quot; programs, and routinely check their integrity. �
The trouble is that error correction then would stop mutation--which would
ultimately slow the rate of evolution of an animal's descendants so much that
they would be unable to adapt to changes in their environments.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>I don�t think this is a strong
argument. but the only better one I can think of is simply that it�s too
expensive and not worth it, or that such an animal would probably die anyway
while healing or something. hmm.</p>
