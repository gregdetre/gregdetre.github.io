<h1 id="how-well-do-children-discriminate-between-a-intentions-and-consequences-b-moral-rules-and-social-conventions">How well do children discriminate between a) intentions and consequences b) moral rules and social conventions?</h1>
<p>Moral development plays a crucially important role in a child�s growth, but is also extremely difficult to do empirical research on. The first hurdle is the same for any discipline discussing morals, which involves refining our intuitive definition of morality. Obviously, we don�t expect infants to spring forth armed with a fully-formed conception of the Ten Commandments, but given the common-sense explanation of moral development as being an example of infants� ability to learn and imitate their parents, so many psychologists have seized Kant�s categorical imperative as best and most empirically-testably embodying the spirit of morality:</p>
<p>�Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature.�</p>
<p>Important means of judging the extent that children can distinguish right from wrong focus on: their ability to place the moral value of an action on the intentions rather than the consequences; immanent justice; universality; autonomy and heteronomy; and assigning higher value to moral rules rather than social or personal conventions.</p>
<p><em>Piaget</em> �s investigations into moral development centred around his idea of reversibility again, and how young children who lack it display egocentricity because they are unable to reverse their perspective and so cannot appreciate other people�s. He claims this egocentricity is strengthened by parents and other adults who act like an <em>�unintelligent government � content to accumulate laws in spite of their contradictions�</em>.</p>
<p>Piaget used paired stories, juxtaposing good intentions with bad consequences and vice versa, to generalise from how the child viewed protagonists in each story to their understanding of how intentions and consequences made an act more or less morally right. He found that younger children (5-9 years) used the consequences as the criteria for morality, whereas older children judged by intentions. He concluded that the irreversibility of their cognitive status prevented them from understanding others� intentions and making proper moral judgements. By this, one assumes that although Piaget was satisfied that the child was empathising enough with the protagonist, he felt that the child could not empathise enough with the �victim� of the consequences, in this case the mother who owns the broken crockery. However, the experiment can still be criticised, even if one accepts that the medium works, because the stories themselves disconnect the nature of the transgression from the bad outcome. Further experiments have been carried out, using a 2x2 matrix of good/bad intentions and serious/light consequences: these showed that if the consequences are controlled (i.e. stay the same whatever the intention) then children judge on the basis of intent, but if the intentions are controlled, they take consequences into account, even though they should be morally irrelevant.</p>
<p>Piaget also told stories where the misdeeds led to a disconnected bad consequence for the perpetrator, this time testing children�s concept of immanent justice (i.e. a sort of just divine retribution). Young children tended to strongly link the wrong behaviour to the subsequent disaster but criticisms have been made that the story itself is influential, requiring a proper study of children�s causal understanding.</p>
<p>Piaget also investigated the idea of universality in moral rules by contrasting them with man-made social conventions (a distinction which philosophers make more guardedly), such as the rules of marbles. Further experiments by <em>Danazzo</em> showed that changes were more readily accepted in the rules the easier the game and the older the child. <em>Turiel</em> took the idea of degrees of universality of rules further, with his tri-partite distinction beween moral (universal) and conventional and personal (both non-universal) rules, arguing however that young children can distinguish between them at an early age. <em>Nucci &amp; Turiel�s</em> comparison between children�s and adults� conceptions of the universality of certain rules as applied to events observed at schools demonstrated a strong agreement between children and the adult judge. Furthermore, these children (aged between 2 and 5) remonstrated moral infringements just as much as the adults did, while the adults responded more than the children to infringements of conventions. The Nucci/Turiel hypothesis also falls down when studies in countries like Brazil and India demonstrate that the distinction between moral and social rules blurs. It is difficult to judge where this ability to distinguish morality from conventions comes from, given that some conventions such as tidying rooms are probably reinforced more often than stealing, for example, though perhaps punished less strongly. Interestingly though, �conventions� such as religious dietary requirements could be regarded as universal in terms of the categorical imperative in proselytising religions, but in other religions which are less missionary in outlook, such rules would not be universal, since there would be no inculcation in the child of wanting all others to follow the same rules. <em>Smetana</em> used strength of response to an event to compare naturally occurring moral or conventional transgressions. This produced exactly the same results as before, with the toddlers responding mainly to the moral transgressions and the adults responding to both, especially the conventional transgressions. <em>Nucci</em> used cartoon strips with moral (e.g. lying, stealing, hitting), conventional (calling the teacher by the first name) and personal violations (long hair, smoking at home). 7-19 year old children had to judge how wrong each action was. Interestingly, the experiment showed no difference between the age groups, and a universally stronger response to the moral violations. Smetana used pictorial representations of various infringements, trying to see whether the conventional infringements would be permissible if there were no rule against them. However, the choices made by the experimenter present the moral choices as all hurting others while the conventional ones were comparably innocuous. However, again the results indicated that moral infringements were judged more serious by both three and four year olds (with a slight extra priority again being given to conventional infringements by the older children) and that conventional infringments were more admissible to a change of rules.</p>
<p>A longtidinal study by Kohlberg using moral dilemmas indicated sequential development, after which he developed a theory which brought together the issues of intentionality and moral/conventional rules, arguing for three broad stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>preconventional � concentration of acts, such as punishment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conventional � intentions are given weight, but only conventional intentions, such as obeying the law and being nice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>post-conventional � judgements are based on the good of society as a whole</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This almost seems to be implying that maturation inevitably leads to a semi-utilitarian outlook.</p>
<p>The question, �when are children�s sense of morals fully developed?� is meaningless. Rather, one could say that, according to Piaget, their understanding of intentions is not complete until about 8 years old. Piaget seems to be trying to use intentionality as an indicator of heteronomy, which might only hold if a heteronomously-guided child also held a concrete conception of immanent justice. On the other hand, their conception of moral as opposed to conventional rules is largely developed very early on. In fact, as they grow older, the emphasis placed upon conventional rules grows until adulthood.</p>
