<h3>What is �theory of mind�?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>An animal has a �theory of mind� when it can form a
representation of the beliefs, desires and capabilities of other animals, and
so predict their behaviour and the probable consequences of their actions in an
internal model. Or, as Heyes (1998) puts it:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>An animal with a theory of mind believes that mental states play a
causal role in generating behavior and infers the presence of mental states in
others by observing their appearance and behavior under various circumstances.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He lists the variety of related terms which ethologists use
in place of, or as aspects of, �theory of mind�:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>&quot;Machiavellian intelligence&quot; (Byrne &amp; Whiten 1988; Whiten
&amp; Byrne 1988), &quot;metarepresentation&quot; (Whiten &amp; Byrne 1991),
&quot;metacognition&quot; (Povinelli 1993), &quot;mind reading&quot; (Krebs
&amp; Dawkins 1984; Whiten 1991), &quot;mental state attribution&quot; (Cheney
&amp; Seyfarth 1990a; 1990b; 1992) and &quot;pan- or pongo-morphism&quot; (Povinelli
1995). </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question of theory of mind also arises in human
developmental psychology, in deciding how early normal human infants� cognitive
abilities develop, and in comparison with the impaired or retarded development
of mentally handicapped, e.g. autistic, children. Unfortunately, ethologists
are still wrangling to some extent over whether any animals have a theory of
mind at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Methodological issues</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first discuss the methodological issues involved in
empirically determining whether animals have theory of mind, then attempt a
survey and critique of the evidence for and against.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hardest part about discerning whether animals have a
theory of mind is designing the experiments. Animal behaviour is often complex
and varied, and can appear to be goal-directed and highly-attuned to how other
animals will react. Yet, this sort of behaviour might well be innate, or
learned through trial and error.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Intentionality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Byrne adopts Dennett�s levels of �intentionality� as the
best means of classifying �theory of mindedness�. Here, he means intentionality
in the philosophical sense, of �aboutness� � see Stanford entry, on
ethologists� confusions with consciousness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kind of innate behaviour that has evolved to exploit
other animals without the agent�s having formed any conception of why the
action is beneficial for them is known as zero-order intentionality. The eyed
hawk-moth is a good example. The markings on its wings, when spread, look like
a pair of hawk eyes staring at the on-looking animal. The hawk-moth �knows�
that when it spreads its wings at small mammals, on whom the hawk predates,
they will probably mistake it for a hawk and flee. However, there appears to be
no intentionality exhibited � the hawk-moth is not representing the mind and behaviour
of the small mammals in its brain, and predicting their behaviour on the basis
of this neural representation. This can be seen in that it uses the same trick
when faced with cardboard props and actual hawks, despite the inappropriateness
of the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First-order intentionality allows that the animal is able to
predict the consequences of its action, i.e. it has formed a representation of
its environment, which may even incorporate other animals as causal agents, but
it does not attribute beliefs and desires to them. First-order intentionality
admits learning, and the formation of a complex representation of the animal�s
environment, but the associations and inferences do not go so far as allowing
the animal to place itself in other situations, or to speculate on mental
processes in other animals. Rather, other animals are just another part of the
sensorium prompting behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is worth noting that when ethologists talk of �deceit� in
animal communication, they may mean either of these �unintentional� levels �
the speech marks around �deceit� highlight the lack of second-order
intentionality behind the action, in order to differentiate this technical use
of the term from human deceit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for an animal to be considered to possess a theory
of mind, it must demonstrate second-order intentionality. Second-order
intentionality is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>reserved for cases when the behaviour shows that the agent has an
intention that in English would be expressed �I want him to think X� (i.e.
mentally representing another�s mental state).<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a problematic definition, since animals do not have
language, and we do not want to have to impute a language of thought to them in
order for them to have a theory of mind. Rather, the definition is intended to
point to second-order intentionality as being those cases where only such an
explanation could explain the animal�s behaviour. As we shall see,
demonstrating this has proved extremely complicated, although there are certain
hall-marks or criteria that could only be explained by genuine second-order
intentionality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Confusions and misattributions of theory of mindedness</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before then, I will consider how we can be misled into
attributing theory of mind to animals which are simply very complex,
highly-evolved or fast learners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Genetic hard-wiring can potentially account for almost any
stereotyped behaviour, even when it involves a long sequence of
carefully-choreographed action. The example of the plover, illustrates this
well. If you were a bird sitting on your eggs, and saw a cat wandering nearby,
what would you do? You could hope the cat doesn�t see you (and many birds
camouflage their nests carefully), you could attack the cat, but you can�t fly
away and leave your eggs, and you can�t move your nest and/or eggs. The plover,
which nests on the ground, has developed a technique of flying out into the
open, flapping about, diving downwards, then feigning an incapacitated wing
injury to distract the predator�s attention, before flying off and hoping that
the cat has forgotten about the nest. A human being, in a similar position and
in a plover�s body, might improvise a similar solution � but the fact that the
plover�s behaviour varies little from plover to plover, without being just one
example of an array of intentional behaviours, and that the plovers do not
modify this behaviour according to the cat�s responses, all suggest that this
intentional-seeming behaviour is entirely genetically hard-wired and
non-intentional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Learnt, non-intentional but intentional-seeming behaviour
can be divided into two types: a) associative learning, or b) as a product of
inferences about observable features of the situation rather than mental states
(Heyes, 1993). To illustrate, �One of the female baboons at Gilgil grew
particularly fond of meat, although the males do most of the hunting. A male,
one who does not willingly share, caught an antelope. The female edged up to
him and groomed him until he lolled back under her attentions. She then
snatched the antelope carcass and ran� (observation by Strum, cited as personal
communication in Jolly 1985).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deception could have been quite accidental, i.e. the
female happened to choose that time to groom the male, and then simply made a
grab for the carcass when an unexpected opportunity arose to do so while he was
lolling back. If the behaviour was not entirely by chance, it could still have
been non-intentional. Again, assume that she chose to groom him at that moment
without any further plan to grab the carcass. If this female had learnt
painstakingly by trial and error after many abortive attempts that stealing
from supine individuals is most likely to be successful, she might simply have
formed an association between snatching food and the sight of a supine
conspecific. Even if the behaviour was based on inference rather than
associative learning, there need not have been any notion of mental state
attached to being supine. That is, she might have inferred that her chances of
successfully snatching the meat were higher based on reasoning about observable
features of the situation, i.e. non-mental categories, without having formed
any representation regarding posture as an indicator of mental state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, particularly intelligent animals can learn through
trial and error from only a very small number of instances that a certain kind
of behaviour elicits a reward, however inexplicably to them. Usually trial and
error learning is facilitated when the animal is operating under rare or
isolated conditions, or where the particular circumstances repeat themselves closely
together, and where the reward (or punishment) is intense. In such cases, an
animal (the �agent�) may learn quickly that a particular behaviour results in
behaviour from another animal (the �target�) that is beneficial, and the agent
will repeat that behaviour. This qualifies as �deception�, in the technical
ethological sense of animal communication, but not in the intentional sense
that requires a theory of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is also important to remember that an animal could have
behaved in an intentional-seeming way by chance. Marc Hauser relates his
observation of Tristan, whose over-amorous attempts towards Borgia cause her to
scream. Her relatives chase Tristan, who suddenly stops and gives an alarm
call. Borgia�s pursuing relatives scatter into the trees, but Tristan stays
where he is, eventually walking away, the chase having been abandoned. Hauser
speculates as to the extent that Tristan had intended the beneficial
consequences. Hauser says that he could not see any signs of nearby danger,
although that is not to say that Tristan might not have simply been mistaken
but well-meaning with his call. Since Tristan never exhibited similar behaviour
again over the course of the study, Hauser�s observation can be categorised
with the �anecdotal� evidence that Whiten and Byrne accumulated in their survey
of primate ethologists� observations. Such evidence is anecdotal in the sense
that each observation is inconclusive and isolated, although together, Whiten
and Byrne�s 253 accumulated reports along similar lines are persuasive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is lastly the possibility, as Byrne himself considers,
of scientific mis-reporting. However, the number of cases of such
intentional-seeming deception cannot all be mis-reported, though they can
easily be mis-interpreted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Possible ways of assessing theory of mindedness</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various related ways in which we can assess
whether an animal does have a theory of mind, or is simply employing innate
behaviour or learned trial and error set-pieces. These include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Appropriateness - How well an animal is able to adapt its
behaviour according to the situation, and whether the animal continues to try
behaviour that has previously seemed intentional to experimenters, now in
completely inappropriate situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Novel situations - When faced with a wholly novel situation,
an animal that is able to improvise behaviour that produces beneficial
consequences,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps requiring intermediary stages or the involvement of
other �tool� animals to achieve a re-defined goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Responding to responses - It is one thing for an animal to
play out an evolved behaviour that usually works, but it is much harder to work
out response behaviour. It would require a whole array of set-piece behaviours,
or a huge number of trial and error situations, or a genuine theory of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Species-wide - By comparing the relative flexibility of
behaviour of conspecifics, ethologists should be able to build up a picture of
how complex the animal�s competence is. If every animal in a species employs
the same range of set-pieces in response to similar situations, especially if
their learning environments differ, then that would indicate an innate basis.
Of course, it can be difficult to discern whether or not this is simply because
that is simply the very best response to the situation. In this case,
experimenters need to try and vary the situation in some way, minimise the
possibility that the animal might have learned it over the course of its life,
and compare how similar the behaviour of wild and captive animals is, as an
indication of innateness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sense of self - It seems plausible that in order to be able
to treat other animals as intentional agents, possessing beliefs and desires,
an agent needs to be able to see itself as just such an intentional agent. This
argument may actually be backwards though � it could be that my being able to
see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>myself</i> as an intentional agent
follows from my mental representations of other animals as intentional agents.
I will consider how much the mirror tests for self-recognition first devised by
Gallup can tell us about theory of mindedness below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Language - In certain cases, it may actually be possible to
ask the animal what it�s belief state is. Kanzi the bonobo chimp and Alex and
the grey parrot both demonstrate considerable linguistic ability � though probably
not quite enough though to give conclusive evidence one way or the other about
their belief states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Survey of the evidence</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will now consider self-recognition, perspective-taking and
false belief experiments as evidence for theory of mind. In considering this
evidence, it is important to consider both the competence of the animal at the
given task, and the validity of the experiment as a whole in demonstrating
theory of mind. This second question is the harder to assess, and of far
greater importance. In order for the validity to be affirmed, it is not simply
enough for there to be no equally plausible non-mentalistic alternative, but
that no non-mentalistic alternative <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>could</i>
explain the behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gallup, who first came up with the idea of the mirror test
(see below) in 1969, maintains that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>knowledge of mental states in others presupposes knowledge of mental
states in oneself and, therefore, that knowledge of self paves the way for an
inferential knowledge of others.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Gallup�s early experiments with chimps, he claimed
that their ability to recognise their own images in mirrors has been replicated
over 20 times, with a variety of species, but mainly primates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, recent research (Reiss &amp; Marino, 2001,
�Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences�) claims that two bottle-nosed
dolphins, Presley and Tab, could recognise themselves in the mirror. They
reacted to their own reflections without the social responses they displayed
when seeing other dolphins, and when black marks were placed in different
places on their bodies, the dolphins then swam to the mirror walls and exposed
the mark to the reflective surface in order to look at it. They spent more time
in front of the mirror after being marked than when they were not marked, and
the first behavior when arriving at the mirror was exposing the black mark to
check it out. It may be worth examining how well the experimenters were able to
quantify this, since they couldn�t simply count the number of times the
dolphins touched the marks, as we can with primates. Reiss claims:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>This is the first conclusive study that shows that there seems to be a
convergence in these abilities between the large-brained primates, including
humans, and a very different animal (a dolphin) that's come from a very different
background and environmental history, and has a very different body type and
brain organization.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, even a fairly concrete demonstration of
self-recognition would not amount to much of a case for a theory of mind. As
Povinelli suggests, they may simply have extended their motor self-concept,
rather than have developed a psychological one, i.e. they do not really
recognize themselves but simply learn an equivalence between their behavior and
what they see in the mirror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dorothy L. Cheney and Robert M. Seyfarth of the University
of Pennsylvania have found that vervet monkeys give alarm calls on seeing a
predator even if other monkeys have already seen it, too. Likewise, they found
that Japanese monkey mothers do not distinguish between offspring that know or
do not know about food or danger when it comes to alerting their babies to the
presence of one or the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evidence that chimpanzees are unable to imagine someone
else�s perspective is quite strong (Povinelli, 1998). This is important,
because chimps <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> pass the mirror
test, indicating that the mirror test may not be as good an indication of
theory of mind as Gallup believes. Chimpanzees pay close attention to gaze
direction. Hauser describes locking gazes with a young female chimpanzee, then
suddenly looking at something behind them, which causes the chimp to
immediately swivel to look in that direction. Also, Frans B. M. de Waal of the
Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory University reported that
chimpanzees do not appear to trust the reassurance gestures of their former
opponents unless such gestures are accompanied by a mutual gaze--that is,
unless they stare directly into one another's eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Povinelli describes an experiment where the chimps first get
used to begging for food from an experimenter sitting just out of reach. When
presented with two experimenters, one holding a banana and the other holding a
block of wood, the chimps predictably begged for the banana. Then, the chimps
were presented with pairs of experimenters in various positions, modelled on
the behaviours observed in the chimps� spontaneous play, including blindfolded
over the eyes, blindfolded over the mouth, wearing a bucket over her head, with
her hands over her eyes or sitting with her back turned to the chimpanzee, all
designed to illustrate a �seeing/not-seeing� contrast. In all but the last
test, the chimps� success at choosing the experimenter who could see them was
no better than chance. When Povinelli et al. set out to decide why they were more
successful when the experimenter�s back was to them, they realised that it
wasn�t that the chimps could tell that the experimenter could not see them, but
because in training, they had been used to begging from front-on experimenters.
In every test they devised, the chimps failed to discriminate between
experimenters that could and could not see their begging behaviour, although
they learned quickly by trial and error when their behaviour would be most
successful. Povinelli contrasts these findings with Flavell et al.�s findings
with human infants, who have shown children as young as two or three years seem
to understand the concept of seeing in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, even if the chimpanzees <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>did</i> discriminate on the basis of which direction the person was facing,
whether their eyes were covered, gaze direction and the like, that would not be
sufficient to attribute a theory of mind. Indeed, it would not matter whether
this belief was learned, or innate. The question that would need to be answered
would again be one of validity. Experimenters need to devise a means of
deciding if the chimps have merely formed a single-order representation of what
situation is most likely to yield reward based on factors like the direction
the person was facing, whether their eyes were covered, gaze direction and the
like. In order to ascribe a theory of mind to the chimps, they would have to be
taking the experimenter�s visual perspective, and moreover, assessing what the
experimenter knows, i.e. forming a set of beliefs about the experimenter�s
beliefs, based on visual perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �false belief� test was suggested by Daniel Dennett in
his response to Premack &amp; Woodruff�s seminal paper, �Does the chimpanzee
have a theory of mind?�. Premack &amp; Woodruff showed Sarah, a female chimp,
videos of a human actor trying to solve problems like reaching inaccessible
objects. Sarah had to choose one of two pictures, one of which depicted a
solution to the problem, such as the actor reaching out of the cage to the
bananas with a stick. Sarah reliably chose the picture of the solution to the
problem, which Premack &amp; Woodruff held to be evidence that Sarah was
imputing mental states, such as wanting to get the bananas, to the human actor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dennett suggested what he thought would prove a more
targeted test for theory of mind, inspired by children�s awareness of Punch�s
�false belief� that Judy is in a box which he throws off a cliff. Wimmer &amp;
Perner (1983) devised the Sally-Anne false belief test for young children.
Children were presented with two dolls, Sally with a basket, and Anne with a
box. Sally places the marble in her basket, and leaves the room. Anne takes the
marble from Sally�s basket, and moves it to her (Anne�s) box. The child is
asked where Sally will look for the marble when she returns. A correct answer
(in combination with correct answers to the naming, reality and memory control
questions) is taken to imply that the child knows where the marble is, and is
also able to recognise that Sally now holds a �false belief�. Criticisms have
been made of this experiment in its current form, as applied to autistic
children (who do not engage themselves in pretend play, but Leslie and Frith
(1988) replicated the study using people rather than dolls, and obtained
similar results), and of the false belief methodology in general as a test of
the theory of mind (Bloom and German, 2000). They claim that the false belief
test places high cognitive and linguistic demands on infants and animals, far
beyond the possession of a theory of mind. However, they argue that the false
belief task should not be abolished, for �while failure � isn�t necessarily
informative about a child or animal�s conceptual abilities, success is�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is worth noting that some philosophers claim that
(some/many) animals are not capable of holding beliefs at all, let alone a
theory of mind. This view takes many forms, with differing strictures. Donald
Davidson (1975), for instance, �claimed that only creatures with the concepts
of truth and falsehood can properly be said to have beliefs, and since these
are meta-linguistic concepts � only language-using animals such as human beings
can have beliefs� (from Dennett, 1995).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast, Dennett and McCarthy employ a �maximally
permissive understanding of the term, � simply presupposing that whatever the
structure [of the information-structures in the animals' brains] is, it is
sufficient to permit the sort of intelligent choice of behavior that is
well-predicted from the intentional stance. So yes, animals have beliefs. Even
amoebas - like thermostats - have beliefs� (Dennett, 1995).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most philosophers would probably allow that the most
cognitively advanced non-human animals have some form of belief.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Janet Halperin gives the example of her
Siamese fighting fish as candidates for having beliefs, for although they do
seem richly amenable (in some regards) to intentional interpretation, on the
other hand she has a neural-net-like model of their control systems that seems
to lack any components with the features beliefs are often supposed to have.
This seems like quite an important point against them. After all, if a few
highly non-intentional, highly-simplified simulations of a small number of
neurons can exhibit behaviour similar to the fighting fish, there is no need to
attribute beliefs to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to briefly consider theory of mindedness,
consciousness and belief-states all together. If we assume that consciousness
is not necessary for, or plays little role in, the fact that we have belief
states and second order intentionality, then it must be that these complex,
higher-order mental states can be represented in entirely connectionist terms.
Certainly, cognitive science research assumes that the representations being
formed of other animals can be seen at a neural level, if not easily
understood. And it does not seem counter-intuitive to consider that there might
be animals, or robots, with theory of mind who are not conscious. A character
in a computer game who responds differently on the basis of what information it
has about the other characters in a game, even if those responses are generated
by an algorithm, could be said to have a theory of mind, without being at all
conscious. Of course, it seems likely that the two will go hand in hand, either
because both seem coincide with complexity, or because one gives rise to the
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given this, we should expect that theory of mind can be
represented in entirely functionalist terms, which means in connectionist
terms, if we are talking at the neural level. The same goes for beliefs, which
exhibit lower order intentionality than theory of mind. Halperin�s neural
network model of her fighting fish could well have a theory of mind, if it can
be understood to be processing what corresponds to the mental states of other
fighting fish (or their simulations). As long as we are confident that no
simple model with only single-level representation could produce the same
results, then, it seems fair to ascribe a theory of mind to the neural network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Returning to animals, I think that Byrne�s (1995) contention
that the great apes definitely do have a theory of mind, but that the case for
monkeys seems especially weak, and little better for dolphins or other
non-primates, will probably prove correct. However, there is a need for
experimenters to focus solely on experiments which yield results that cannot be
explained in terms of both mentalistic and non-mentalistic processes.</p>
