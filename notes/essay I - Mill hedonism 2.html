Bentham�s quantitative hedonism with Mill�s qualitative hedonism. Which of the
two is the more convincing theory?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Both
Bentham and Mill attempt to formulate a universal moral maxim based on a
prudential theory, i.e. they assert that the pursuit of pleasure is the drive
in everyone�s life, and then assert that consequently, the ultimate goal of an
aggregate of people is the maximisation of the totality of pleasure (or
�utility�) of that aggregate. Thus, by indiscriminately summing the overall
pleasure and pain caused to the aggregate (including onself) by an action, one
can assess the <i>morality</i> of that action. In this way, both Mill�s and
Bentham�s hedonisms use utility as the gauge of value and goodness � whatever
most increases (or least decreases) the aggregate utility is the best, and
right, action. This allows for a sliding scale of goodness, as well as direct
comparisons between actions. Despite the appealing simplicity of the theory,
there are complications, not least in the practicalities of such a theory, e.g.
we cannot know the ultimate future ramifications of an action; we might be
reluctant to throw our father out of a hot air balloon to save a scientist with
a cure for cancer, despite the utilitarian imperative; and there is no easy way
to measure the pleasure resultant from an action. It is this last issue of the
calculation of utility that most separates Bentham�s quantitative with Mill�s
qualitative hedonism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Here,
we are concerned only with the prudential theory, hedonism, upon which the
over-arching moral theory rests. If we cannot determine the utility of an
action for an individual, we will not be able to apply hedonism to an aggregate
of people, and utilitarianism is not practiceable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Hedonism
conjures up thoughts of reprobate parties on the beach, replete with drink,
drugs and hopefully sex. Yet, as advocates of utilitarianism stress, pleasure
need not simply refer to the �baser�, sensual pleasures; we gain pleasure from
love, poetry, music and discussion, and experience sadness at boredom,
loneliness and another person�s plight. Pleasure in the utilitarian sense is
meant as far more than a fleeting euphoria. There are long-lasting, acquired
pleasures too, perhaps gained only after effort or sacrifice. But can our
enjoyment of these varied pursuits be directly compared under the umbrella term
�pleasure�? Can the pleasure derived from reading an evocative poem be ranked
against vomiting oneself unconscious after a night stealing traffic cones with
the lads?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Bentham,
with his penchant for the orderly, argues that the different variables like
intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness allow us
to arrive at an overall value for the pleasure of an action. I am going to
summarily dismiss the notion that such variables can be assigned precise
numerical values, totalled and that one pleasure can correspond to an exact
fraction or multiple of another. Though it might hypothetically be possible to
attempt this by measuring neurotransmitter release in the brain, for instance,
such a hedonometer would not be in the spirit of Bentham�s argument, and
reliance upon such a device would mean that we would not be able to make moral
judgements without its help. We can take a hedonic calculus slightly more
seriously if we regard it simply as a system for comparing and ranking
different pleasures. Even in this form, it still makes the strong implicit
assumption that all enjoyable activities give rise to more or less concentrated
or long-lasting of the same feelings of pleasure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>It
could be argued that Bentham has not considered the vividness with which a
pleasure is remembered � after all, a tremendous orgasm that an amnesic has no
memory of may as well never have happened. Bentham�s elegant solution is to
consider this under fecundity as a pleasure which gives rise to other pleasures
over time, such as a poem rembered and savoured. There is a small question
remaining about the certainty and propinquity of a pleasure: don�t we derive
pleasure in anticipating a distant and unlikely dream, despite its remoteness
and uncertainty?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>In
contrast, Mill would like to argue that some pleasures are more intrinsically
worthy than others. To explain, let us draw an analogy with another type of
qualitative difference, unrelated to hedonism. We might say that the human mind
is a higher form of �intelligence� than a supercomputer. The supercomputer
might be able to perform a mathematical operation in a few seconds that would
take us many hours to do with pencil and paper, but it will never write poetry.
No matter how many supercomputers we put together, working at any speed and for
any length of time, they will not exhibit any spontaneity, originality,
self-awareness or learn<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
We can work at their level, but they can never rise to ours � duration and
intensity can not give rise to a qualitative change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>In
order to accept that a qualitative ranking is possible, there has to be some
means of objective assessment. One way to rank pleasures would be to appeal to
some other, even higher standard than the maximisation of pleasure, upon which
to base our judgement. For instance, Aristotle effectively categorises the
moral and the intellectual <i>ar&#275;te</i> as being separate, with the
contemplative life being the higher, but more exclusive. Mill is explicit in
saying that the value of a pleasure lies solely in the pleasure it gives,
refusing to admit of any standard to which hedonism is subordinate. However,
Mill comes close to this, with his claim, �Better to be a fool satisfied than Socrates
dissatisfied�. I think he might have hoped that few philosophers of note would
dare to disagree, and that those who did could be ridiculed into submission.
The irony lies in what Socrates himself might have replied to this screen: �Why
should I prefer the endless discontent which my inquisitive intelligence brings
me � perhaps I secretly long for the unadulterated joy of being a pig in mud.
What would I lack that I would wish for?� It seems to me that there is an
unavoidable predisposition in the sort of judge Mill has in mind to rank the
intellectual pleasures higher, and I think this is Mill�s only recourse to such
a response from Socrates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Mill�s
answer to comparing two pleasures is to ask those who have experienced both
pleasures, and state that if there is a consensus in preferring one of the two,
then that one must be the higher. Fairness dictates that any judge would need
to be able to make a comparison based on his own experience. After all, human
preference is the only way that pleasures can be ranked, since pleasure is in
the eye of the beholder. However, individuals (who may or may not have
experienced both pleasures) may disagree with this consensus. Mill does not
cater for such obstacles to his objective standard of utility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>But
can we judge the value of one type of pleasure relative to another objectively?
Let us take an example. We might be able to find a philosopher who knows the
joys of a musty library late at night, as well as having experimented with
clubbing in his younger days. He would fit our description of a judge who has
had experience of both types of pleasure, and so we might turn to him and ask
him which he prefers. If every philosophy professor prefers elbow patches to
Ecstasy tablets, we might then decide that the intellect provides a �higher�
form of pleasure. By this, we mean that the higher pleasure is not comparable
to the lower, and no amount, intensity or duration of the lower pleasure will
be equatable with the higher. But perhaps our philosophy professor was awkward
and repressed, because his handsome and charismatic older brother made fun of
him as a child. This older brother is a bright, extravert, outdoors sort who
never liked philosophy. Mill might argue that the older brother has never
learnt to fully experience the refined and buried bliss of metaphysics and so
cannot be a fair judge of its merits. Consequently, his obvious pleasure in
clubbing would be denigrated because our younger philosophy professor says so.
Yet we could say the very same about the younger professor�s abortive evenings
clubbing. This example is intended to show how varied and ingrained our own
views on what is pleasurable are. To rank either philosophy or clubbing as an
objectively higher pleasure seems impossible (without recourse to a further absolute
standard, which Mill is averse to doing), and would mean subordinating one�s
life to the other. It seems ridiculous and iniquitous to arbitrate that no
length of time spent in Ibiza will ever be worth a single hour bent over a copy
of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>If
this example shows us anything, it illustrates how varied and incompatible our
pleasures can be. Mill�s own acknowledgement of the long-lasting effects of
early indoctrination backfires here. There are men with the intelligence of
Socrates who choose not to follow his philosophising lead � we enjoy what our
abilities, genes, neuroses and upbringing lead us to enjoy. To try and
pigeon-hole people into preferring the higher pleasures cannot be justified,
without mediocritising our individual differences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>When
Aristotle stated that the <i>telos</i>, or end goal, of all our lives is
happiness, he certainly had more than beach parties in mind. P<span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>erhaps a stronger argument in favour of Mill�s
qualitative hedonism can be formed, to reassemble a hierarchy of happiness. Let
us consider this in terms of the pleasure-juice drip: this remarkable 25th
century device comes in the form of a cufflink, which the wearer can press
gently to release pleasure-juice (the distilled chemical which alters our brain
state, giving rise to feelings of pleasure) directly into our blood stream.
Under Bentham�s hedonic calculus, such an action would be intense, last as long
as we like, be certain, propinquitous and pure. Yet, just as a happy life in a
virtual �experience machine� feels empty, we find ourselves inexplicably shying
away from sinking into the throes of a lifelong orgasm. Here, we might turn to
Mill�s qualitative hedonism, in the hope that it can show that such a pleasure,
though intense, would rank at the very bottom of his scale. But remember,
Mill�s scheme makes no appeal to an ultimate standard requiring self-sacrifice,
intellect or effort to attain the higher pleasures � it requires only that
judges who have experienced both types of pleasure consistently prefer one. And
what judge, other than the exceptionally high-minded individual, would prefer
an arduous life of adversity or arduousness when pleasure is immediate and
cost-free? Mill�s qualitative hedonism would, quite to the contrary, rank such
unearned pleasure as the very highest form of pleasure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>Both
Mill�s and Bentham�s versions of hedonism seem flawed, and it is difficult to
happily reconcile them. Mill�s qualitative hedonism might appeal at first,
especially to those who would agree with what qualifies as a higher pleasure.
However, it does appear to lead to a situation where other people, judging
which pleasure is higher based on their experience of both, would be in a
position to ordain what gives the highest pleasure. , and ultimately whose
pleasure is worth most. When such a hedonism provides the basis for a moral
theory, it will ultimately arbitrate whose enjoyment is worth most, and weight
the morality of actions in their favour. Even more damaging to Mill�s case,
once one takes the first step of admitting that pleasure is differentiated,
utility becomes not a single but a fragmented goal, and we lose sight of our
aim of a universal moral principle. For how can everyone�s utility be summed,
as the Greatest Happiness Principle demands, if one type of pleasure is
qualitatively different to another?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>One
the other hand, Bentham�s attempt to precisely quantify pleasure doesn�t seem
strictly practiceable � if it was, we�d be able to turn to computers for moral
judgements. I think it makes more sense if we take a weaker reading than he
intended, and simply acknowledge that various factors influence how much we
enjoy something, e.g. intensity, duration, fecundity etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>One
way to bring Mill and Bentham together would be to add a new variable,
approximating to the �rank� of a pleasure. The weighting for this could be
derived from an empirical study along the lines Mill envisaged, or simply by
each individual ascribing pleasures their own value. Such a weighting would
probably have to be logarithmic, to assuage the likes of Mill who who would
rate the higher pleasures as being incomparably far beyond the baser pleasures.
However, there is a way to do less violence to Bentham�s original formulation.
I think that Bentham intended �intensity� to be gauged relative to the other
experiences a person has enjoyed, and that this would naturally tend to weight
pleasures that they have enjoyed more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:15.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'>This
flexibility is the advantage of Bentham�s scheme � the extent to which a
pleasure is rated according to his hedonic calculus should correspond exactly
with the extent to which that person enjoyed it. This sounds trivial, but it is
as it should be. There seems to be an unavoidable danger that Mill�s hedonism
would dictate engaging in activities which give higher pleasure, but which
might actually be less enjoyable to the majority of individuals, e.g. those who
simply do not enjoy philosophising. His distinction of higher pleasures is such
that the most moral life for a �fool� might involve a continual and
unsatisfying effort to learn to enjoy these higher pleasures, perhaps at the
expense of contentment at one�s lot.</p>
