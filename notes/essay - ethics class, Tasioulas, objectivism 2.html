<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meta-ethical landscape is dotted with different
boundaries, signposts and enclaves, huddled around a few central questions: Are
the sentences we use when we make moral claims capable of being true or false?
If so, are any such moral sentences actually true? Would such moral claims be
objective? Or would they be relativised according to biology, culture or whim?
To what extent do different cultures agree on fundamental first order
principles? Why do moral beliefs have a motivating force?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before going further, I am going to try and consider what
the word �objective� means. The simplest way of characterising objectivity is
universality. We might say that a moral claim, e.g. that �torturing babies is
wrong� is objectively true, really only to mean that everybody in the world
agrees with it. The problem with this universality definition is that just
because everyone agrees with it doesn't make it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>right</i>, in the way that we want things to be right. We might imagine
that if 99% of the world was killed in a nuclear holocaust, leaving only the
obscure Brazilian Cocoabutter tribe whose DNA is mangled by the fallout such
that every single member of the tribe from then on was to take singular delight
in torturing babies, we would not agree (from the grave) with Cocoabutter
philosophers who considered that �torturing babies is right� because everybody
says so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps we could throw the net of objectivity a little
wider, and appeal to anybody (i.e. any rational being) capable of understanding
the statement we�re making for agreement. This is closer to Nagel�s iterative
definition of objectivity � in order to �acquire a more objective understanding
of some aspect of life or the world, we step back from our initial view of it
and form a new conception which has that view and its relation to the world as
its object�. Objectivity is defined negatively in terms of subjectivity � take
a subjective viewpoint � our own, for example. Step back from it slightly, form
a conception which wholly contains and widens that viewpoint, e.g. other
members of Corpus Christi College. As we broaden to the entire human
population, and the entire population of rational beings, we hopefully lose the
most misleading and myopic aspects of our own perspective, and approach a view
which incorporates such a wide variety of physiologies, priorities and
perspectives that we approximate towards a �view from nowhere�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moral objectivists tend to characterise their propositions
in terms of truth. Truth seems to be beckoning towards some optimal
objectivity, the objectivised view that one would have if one could incorporate
the perspectives of the entire space of (entirely) rational beings together. It
is for this reason that truth is often described in terms of the point on which
a perfect inquiry converges. Of course, pragmatists and relativists like Rorty
and Putnam are desperately keen to rid us of just this sort of notion of truth,
but that comes later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, I want to distinguish absoluteness from objectivity.
�It can be objective that an interpretation or an explanation is the correct
one, given the interests which are relevant in the context�<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
The way I imagine this is to consider a black box, which we�ll call the
Ethicomatic 9500. The Ethicomatic 9500 contains the rules by which moral
features supervene on natural features. You place a moral agent inside,
complete with the details of his choices, circumstances, context, culture,
interests and values, and out the other side, it prints out on ticker tape what
the right action for that agent should be. Our hypothetical moral objectivist,
when given one of these for Christmas, excitedly taps in the details for
various dilemmas that he and his friends have argued over, and disappointedly
finds that sometimes, the �right� act will be different for different people,
even when the extraneous circumstances are identical. He tries to take it back,
claiming that it�s not giving him an objective answer. What the shopkeeper will
tell him is that he is confusing objectivity with absoluteness. The answer it
gives may be the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>objectively</i> right
answer, but it may be different according to the particular circumstances,
culture, interests and values of the agent. This corresponds with Wiggins�
first characterisation of relativity (i.e. contextualised relativity, or
�interest relativity�). </p>

margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>But all such truth-apt moral

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There are no truth-apt moral

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

people, states of the world etc. (e.g. �Boo for torturing babies!�)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If one holds that sentences ascribing rightness or wrongness
to actions are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capable</i> of being true
or false, one is left with one of the top two objectivist/cognitivist
positions. According to Smith, believing that there are such truth-apt moral
sentences, and that some really are true defines the moral realist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gowans adds an important further epistemological
qualification: that we are able to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>know</i>
these moral propositions, that is, that we have the capacity to justify a
correct moral belief. Otherwise, living in a world with truth-apt and true
moral propositions that we have inadequate/incomplete knowledge of would
probably leave us as quietists, unable to defend or persuade one another about
our moral views.</p>

<h3>Arguments against moral objectivism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a>
provides early versions of the two major arguments against moral objectivism
that I am going to consider, which he terms the argument from relativism
(though I prefer the label, �the disagreement argument�) and the argument from
queerness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The disagreement argument can be stated in various ways.
Incorporating Gowans� approach, it starts from the empirical observation that
there �are widespread and deep moral disagreements that appear persistently
resistant to rational resolution�. Then, he reiterates the definition of moral
realism which has �the capacity for being justified in our moral beliefs� as a
prerequisite. Finally, �agreement between well-informed, reasonable persons is
a key indicator of the extent to which we have the capacity for being justified
in our (moral) beliefs�. Taken together, these suggest that the persistent lack
of agreement indicates a limited capacity for being justified in our moral
beliefs, undermining moral realism. The strength of this conclusion rests on
the combined strength of each of these premises: how widespread, deep and
persistent these disagreements are; how key an indicator of justification of
belief a lack of agreement is considered to be; whether moral objectivism
requires us to be wholly justified in all our beliefs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An important rebuttal concerns the extent to which these
cross-cultural variations can be explained as arising out of the application of
general principles to different concrete circumstances. This is the hope
motivating the moral system builders like Mill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>further rebuttals to the
disagreement argument<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie�s argument from queerness confronts objectivism at
the metaphysical and epistemological level, though it requires substantial
revision to be as forceful as it can be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The epistemological half of his argument leads him to claim
that any moral objectivist is committed to some variant of intuitionism, since
values would be entities or qualities of a very strange sort inaccessible to us
by naturalistic means, and so requiring some sixth �moral�/intuitive sense.
Certainly, if such a sense existed, we would expect it to have led to a far
more painless convergence on ethical views than even a charitable survey of
disagreements within and between communities would reveal. Of course, Mackie
mentions Price�s criticism that much of our fundamental non-moral knowledge
(such as essence, number, identity, solidity, infinite time and space,
causation etc.) is seemingly subject to the argument from queerness when put
like this. Fortunately of course, they can be accommodated easily within a
naturalistic framework, as I will discuss shortly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The metaphysical half of his argument questions what sort of
ontological status such objective values would have. He contends that they
would have to be something like Plato�s Forms, in order to marry an abstract
objectivity with a motivation to act accordingly. He is unable to conceive what
possible necessary connection could link natural features and moral features �
following Hume, he knows that continual coincidence is not enough to replace
semantic or logical necessity in harnessing the moral and the naturalistic.
Attempts to naturalise ethics have gained in popularity since Mackie�s
criticisms were made, and to an extent he could be accused of attacking a straw
man. G. E. Moore is amongst the only philosophers to have advocated such a
fundamental realm of extra, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>sui generis</i>,
non-natural ontological [moral] properties. As well as suffering from all of
the problems listed above, he was unable to explain how or why these
non-natural moral properties supervened on particular natural properties, and
whether this link between the moral and natural was contingent. However, a
strong case can be made for ethical naturalism, as I will try and show.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Broadly, naturalism is the view that the world is (entirely)
amenable to study through empirical science. The explanatory and predictive
richness of empirical science has persuaded many philosophers of the
plausibility of such a naturalistic picture of the universe. Smith, for one, is
happy to couch his moral realism entirely within a naturalistic framework,
arguing that whatever feature of an act that gives it its rightness or
wrongness must be constrained by our conception of the world, which is a
naturalistic one (at least for the secularists to which we�re appealing).
Consequently, an object�s features are exclusively natural features. In order
then to make sense of moral sentences� truth-aptitude, moral features must be
supervening on natural features of the world. (Supervenience in this way can be
defined as saying that any two acts which are identical in all of their natural
features must be alike in their moral features as well.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, Moore devised what has come to be known as
the �open question argument�, which would, if sound, lay all naturalising
attempts firmly to rest. Let us say that we had come up with a system for
evaluating the rightness of an act given knowledge of all the pertinent
circumstances involved (i.e. its natural features). To take a simple and cheery
example, let us imagine that our theory contends that all �right� acts involve
red objects. What it is, on this naturalistic account, for an act to be
�right�, is for it to involve a red object � we are positing an analytic (i.e.
conceptual) equivalence between the rightness of an act and the redness of the
objects nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moore�s open question argument says that just because acts
of a given moral feature always have a certain natural feature, does not mean
that the moral and natural feature are the same. In our example, Moore�s
argument would be aiming to refute this (as well as for any other natural
feature that we chose to put in place of redness). First, we ask ourselves
whether �this act involves lots of red objects, but does it involve lots of red
objects?� The answer is an obvious, even trivial, yes. The two clauses contain
identical (i.e. analytically equivalent) phrases. This is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>closed</i> question. Now we ask what should
be the same question, substituting in our supposed analytic equivalence, and
ask �this act involves lots of red objects, but is it right?� At this point we
scratch our heads, and have to subject each other to some reasoned arguments.
It is not at all obvious in the same way as the previous question (�this act
involves lots of red objects, but does it involve lots of red objects?�) that
the answer is yes. This second question is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>open</i> question. Thus, rightness and redness of objects cannot be
analytic equivalents, i.e. they do not pick out the same feature. This argument
can be irritatingly wheeled out to seemingly show that rightness cannot be
identical with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i> natural feature of
acts at all. In a naturalistic world, we seem to be left as nihilists with no
true moral beliefs intact at all. Given that we weren't very impressed with the
idea of non-naturalistic objective moral values that Moore suggested take the place
of supervenience on natural features, we can be glad that there is one weak and
one strong response to be made to the open question argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The weak response tries to argue by analogy with H<sub>2</sub>O
and water. If we swap �water� for �rightness� and �H<sub>2</sub>O� for
�redness�, then the open question argument seems to show that water is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> analytically equivalent to H<sub>2</sub>O
(since it is still an open, i.e. non-obvious question whether �this substance
is H<sub>2</sub>O, but is it water?�). We know <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>a posteriori</i> that water is analytically equivalent to H<sub>2</sub>O,
yet Moore�s argument purports to show that they aren't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves naturalistic moral realists with the problem of
showing that the natural and the moral features are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>a posteriori</i> equivalent. At first sight, this seems to parallel the
usual empirical scientific method. But Harman<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a>
tries to argue that there are hidden difficulties in trying to test and confirm
moral principles in the same way as scientific principles. When I am building a
theory, whether scientific or moral, I am trying to fit it around observations
in the real world. In both cases, I probably lack sufficient evidence to
falsify certain hypotheses I have, and in both cases, my observations are
themselves biased by my hypotheses and preconceptions to some degree. I think
Harman is saying that the difference between scientific and moral
theory-building lies in the extra layer between moral observations and the
underlying moral theory. A scientific observation informs a scientific theory.
A behavioural observation informs a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>psychological</i>
theory, from which we then try to abstract to a moral theory. One�s own moral
sensibilities colour behavioural observations in a way that they don't when
considering physical observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think that there is a much stronger, and simpler, attack
that can be made on the open question argument that focuses on the notion of
analyticity. Analyticity may be opaque � it should not be judged on the basis
of obviousness, or whether or not an equivalence is open to reasoned argument.
If we consider what we mean when we discuss a colour, we are trying to pin down
�the property of objects that causes them to look red to normal perceivers
under standard conditions�, which is a complex set of constraints involving the
light conditions, perceiver�s retinal defects etc. Here we can see that
analyticity allows for reasoned argument in determining whether the complex set
of constraints represented by the given word is entailed by the proposed
analysis. If we accept this account of conceptual analysis, then we can see
that the open question argument is simply too stringent in its application of
analyticity, and so fails to refute the equivalence between �rightness� and any
given natural feature <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>,
putting the naturalistic project back on track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Relativism/pragmatism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want now to consider a positive non-objectivist account.
I�ll start with a fairly extreme non-objectivist stance, termed �pragmatism� by
its proponents. Its most eloquent advocate is probably Richard Rorty, and it
relates to the entire metaphysical edifice, swallowing meta-ethics within it.
It�s a little bit difficult to fully absorb, and frankly, a little bit
Continental. I�m going to try and avoid getting embroiled in details,
especially skirting around where prominent contemporary pragmatists disagree
with each other, and just sketch out an outline of a pragmatist, non-realist
metaphysical picture, and discuss where this leaves meta-ethics, and how it
relates to relativism in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty wants to attack the very notion of truth as it�s been
handed down through the philosophical generations since Plato. I�ll start with
some descriptions of the sort of truth he wants to dismiss: �Truth is
correspondence to the intrinsic nature of reality� (Plato). Truth as �the
accurate representation of reality�. Truth as the single, complete, universal,
objective, incontrovertible, possibly inaccessible set of beliefs. As he puts
it, �the picture which holds traditional philosophy captive is that of the mind
as a great mirror, containing various representations � some accurate, some
not�, with philosophy peering into and polishing this mirror in the hope of
seeing a better, clearer image of the universe reflected in their own minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead, he wants us to �treat beliefs not as
representations but as habits of action, and words not as representations but
as tools�. �There is no point in asking whether a belief represents � either
mental or physical reality�. Rather, we should ask, �For what purposes would it
be useful to hold that belief?�. To sum up, the argument should �not be about
which of us has got the universe right�. �We cannot regard truth as a goal of
inquiry�. �The purpose of inquiry is to achieve agreement among human beings
about what to do, to bring about consensus on the ends to be achieved and the
means to be used to achieve those ends.� �All areas of culture are parts of the
same endeavour to make life better. There is no deep split between theory and
practice�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this way, world-views are like clothing. If things get
cold, we wear the warmest clothing we have. If we find a better, warmer fabric,
we wear that instead. If the climate changes, we don a new, more suitable
garment. There is no single, true clothing (belief/belief-set, world view etc.)
best suited to the environment (read universe), no one ideal fabric that we are
converging upon, just a series of improving cognitive apparatuses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to see how this relates to ethics, it�s necessary
to flesh out this relativist metaphysical picture a little more (excerpted from
Rorty�s article on Putnam<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

deeply into what we call 'reality' that the very project of representing
ourselves as being 'mappers' of something 'language-independent' is fatally
compromised from the start. Like Relativism, but in a different way, Realism is
an impossible attempt to view the world from nowhere� (RHF 28)</p>

</span><![endif]>The �supremacy of the agent point of view�. �If we find that
we must take a certain point of view, use a certain 'conceptual system', then
we must not simultaneously advance the claim that it is not really 'the way

Many Faces of Realism</i>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>To say, as [Bernard] Williams sometimes does, that convergence
to one big picture is required by the very concept of knowledge is sheer
dogmatism ... It is, indeed the case that ethical knowledge cannot claim
absoluteness; but that is because the notion of absoluteness is incoherent (RHF
171)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This does not fit obviously into Smith�s tri-partite picture
of descending levels of realism. This view sits somewhere amongst the most
anti-realist positions in Smith�s tri-partite schema (although pragmatism
certainly need not be committed to emotivism/expressivism).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first excerpt makes immediate trouble for the
cognitivist by attacking the idea that reality can be objectively expressed in
linguistic (i.e. propositional) form. The cognitivist knows that this is
assumption takes him out on a limb a little, but I think it actually makes him
much more vulnerable than the attacks from emotivism reveal. Specifically,
Putnam is claiming that our cognitive and linguistic processes are so
interwoven that a �language-independent� representation of reality is �fatally
compromised from the start�. But this is exactly what the cognitivist is trying
to do � cognitivism hopes that we can use language as a means of representing
moral facts, which we presume are not inherently linguistic. For all we know,
syntax, vocabulary and fundamental linguistic form could all be unavoidably
imposing upon or anthropomorphising our conception of moral facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second and third points very succinctly, though broadly,
make the case for relativism. Amidst the plurality of possible views that we
could adopt, some might be preferable. The preferred action for a given person
can be considered to be a function of their interests and values (incorporating
culture, biology and circumstance).<span style='color:red'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>discuss Wiggins� five brands of
relativism<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It�s very difficult to satisfactorily refute this pragmatist
picture, for a number of reasons. One important one is that unless it can be
shown to be clearly and irredeemably self-refuting, it can simply accommodate
and re-cast any alternative (e.g. more realist) metaphysics as a useful,
interim world-view that we can gainfully employ until another comes along which
will allow us to function better as people and as a culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>Moral relativism as a standalone

<p class=MsoNormal>Nietzsche�s dark and nebulous figure lurks behind mentions
of nihilism and immoralism, but in a complicated fashion. I�ve deliberately
avoided bringing him into the debate, because it�s very difficult to see where
he fits into the classifications that have been discussed. Of course, this is
partly because his views evolve and shift radically between (and sometimes
within) books. On the one hand, his discussions of morality (in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Genealogy of Morals</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Beyond Good and Evil</i>) largely take the
form of a descriptive or narrative analysis of the master/slave moral systems
over past centuries. It would be twisting his words to try and shoe-horn the
master morality that he advocates as being an �objective� morality � it is
simply what he desires of (and prescribes for) the human race. On the other
hand, when he talks of the Overman as the joyous affirmation of mankind, he is
subverting any moral/value systems that exist � the Overman lives to create his
own values, to be his own system. It is the task of the philosophical <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>labourers</i> to catalogue and describe the
moral systems of the past, and the task of the philosophers of the future to
�step outside their own time� as part of a continual renewal through the
�revaluation of all values�. If anything, this is the ultimate subjectivism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nietzsche is interesting here in at least one other major
respect � when banishing God, teleology, metaphysics and the rational and moral
world order in one triumphant sweep, he also laid bare how empty any
non-naturalistic atheistic moral realism must be. When Mackie argues against
objective moral values as being �queer�, he is unwittingly gesturing at the
space left behind in our metaphysical framework formerly occupied by a deity. <i

sees room for optimism in this. He points out that the vast majority of
philosophical thought so far about morality has been based on a theistic
metaphysics, and we really have only been pursuing non-religious ethics for a
very short time in the grand scheme of things. </p>

Honestly, I really have. It�s just that I couldn't keep track of them all when
