<p class=MsoNormal>Explanations of why animals recognise their relatives can be
given at the level of the organism or the level of the gene. �Selfish gene
theory� ties the two together. In Richard Dawkins� helpful terminology,
animals, humans, plants and any other life are termed �survival machines�. This
serves as a continual reminder that all life can be considered an expression of
its genes. If the phenotype is not adaptive, i.e. gives rise to a body which
survives long enough to bring forth lots of children who are themselves
adaptive, then the genes which are being expressed will not proliferate into
the population. If the genes do give rise to adaptive traits, then that
organism will be more likely to survive and produce more offspring, producing
more organisms with similar genes. Dawkins is advocating what Daniel Dennett
might term the �intentional stance�: ascribing intentions, purpose and forward-looking
mentality to decidedly non-conscious objects as a shortcut to describing
purposive-seeming activity. Rather as we say that our alarm clock will
�remember� to wake us up in the morning, or that the thermostat �realised� that
it was getting too hot, our selfish genes �want� us to be as adaptive as
possible, so that they get passed on through generations and around the
population. We have evolved to recognise our relatives either because it may
help us survive as organisms, or because they are sufficiently genetically
similar to us that their survival (even at our expense) benefits both sets of
our shared genes. This idea that behaviour towards other organisms will vary
according to their relatedness was put forward most persuasively by Bill
Hamilton (1964) in quite mathematical terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before considering kin recognition specifically, it is worth
noting that co-operation in kin groups makes sense for animals for all the same
reasons that any sort of altruism or co-operation in groups makes sense.
Axelrod &amp; Hamilton�s (1984) theoretical work on the Prisoners� Dilemma or
Wilkinson�s (1984) observations of regurgitation of blood by vampire bats lend
credence to our strong intuition that it may well be in our own individual best
interests to co-operate, or even act in altruistic-seeming ways. Kin selection
is just one of four explanations for the evolution of co-operation, the others
being mutualism, manipulation and reciprocity. Mutualism is where all
co-operating individuals receive an immediate benefit from co-operation, e.g.
lionesses are far more effective hunting zebras together than alone (Caraco
&amp; Wolf 1975). Manipulation is where one animal deceives the other into
benefitting it unwillingly and/or unknowingly. Reciprocation is like mutualism,
but spread out over time or across numerous encounters, as in the Prisoners�
Dilemma model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The index of relatedness is a simple measure of how
genetically similar two animals are likely to be, based on how the genes are
passed from one generation to another, and the number of generations between
them. Identical twins have a relatedness of 1. In the case of humans, the index
of relatedness between a son and a father is 0.5, since 50% of the son�s genome
is taken from the father�s genome (mutations can be ignored for our purposes),
and there is only one generation separating them. Similarly, the index of
relatedness between two siblings is also 0.5, since two siblings� genomes are
derived from the same parental genetic pool, but may contain anywhere between 0
and 100% identical genes. On average though, 50% of their genes will be shared.
It is worth noting that parent-child relations are asymmetrical because the
child is likely to produce more offspring over its remaining lifetime than its
parent, as well as being less able to fend for itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the number of generations (the total �generation
distance� separating the two individuals from their most recent common
ancestor(s)) increases, the probable genetic similarity between individuals
halves. I am only likely to share �, i.e. (�)<sup>2</sup>, of my grandfather�s
genes, or 1/8 of my first cousin�s. From the selfish gene�s point of view, the
survival of one genetically-similar organism is as good as another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The situation is slightly different for non-diploid species.
Human beings and most mammals are diploid, that is, their chromosomes are
ordered in pairs, and offspring derive their genome equally from both parents.
Some members of the order Hymenoptera, for instance, derive their genetic code
solely from the female side. Bees provide the best example of this, and it is
one of the reasons that their eusocial hive system is so well-developed.
�Eusociality� describes an advanced level of social organization, in which a
single female or caste produces the offspring and non-reproductive individuals
cooperate in caring for the young. They illustrate the �caring� vs �bearing�
distinction, in that the bearer of a child need not necessarily be the person
that rears, feeds and teaches it. In hives, although the queen bee bears all of
the bees in a given generation, all the sister bees in the hive care for them,
since the genetic similarity between the bearer and the carers is so high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mole-rats provide the first known example of a mammalian
eusocial society. Jarvis (1994) considers two species of mole-rat, the naked
and the Damaraland mole-rats. Being able to compare the two species is helpful,
because we are better able to exclude �red herring� factors like the naked
mole-rats� glabrousness, poikilothermy and extreme inbreeding. Although
diploid, both species live in small colonies composed of close kin, with one
breeding female and one to three mates. Living in groups allows them to survive
the long droughts, finding enough food for the entire colony when it rains
enough for them to extend their burrows. Like other cases of mutual
reciprocity, the probability of the co-operating colony surviving over time is
far higher than the chances of any individual mole-rat trying to find its own
food in the limited time-window, defending the burrow against predators and
being able to dig a large enough burrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, there is a further reason why we might not expect
siblings to treat each other with the same care that parents treat children in
most real world situations: certainty. A mother knows for a fact that an infant
is her child because she gave birth to it. However, a sibling does not know for
certain that another infant is genetically related. The other infant could have
fallen into the nest at hatching time, the eggs could have been swapped, or it
might be a half-brother or half-sister. In the same way, a father cannot ever
be as certain as his mate that an infant is his, despite his best efforts to
fend off other males.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Animals are able to recognise each other in a number of
ways. Recognising relatives is even more difficult, since it not only requires
differentiating between and remembering different individuals, but also
assessing their relatedness (sometimes in cases where they�ve never even seen
the individual before).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simplest and most obvious method is simply to label
inside the nest or home as kin. In most cases, this method works well. However,
other animals have devised various means of exploiting such na� criteria. The
cuckoo is the most well-known example, depositing its eggs inside other birds�
nests to be cared for unwittingly as if part of the family. Over evolutionary
time, victims of such deception like the reed warbler have learnt to be
extremely aggressive towards adult cuckoos near their nest, and to become
better and better at distinguishing cuckoo eggs from their own species. In
opposition, cuckoos have evolved to lay eggs that are harder and harder to tell
apart from reed warblers�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An only slightly more sophisticated method focuses on those
you grow up with. Lorenz�s famous �imprinting� experiments with young geese
illustrate that they will extend the notion of kin outside the species,
following the first conspicuous moving object they see after hatching, whether
that object is their mother, Konrad Lorenz himself, or an oil tanker.
Similarly, Holmes and Sherman (1982) showed that sibling recognition in
Belding�s ground squirrels is heavily skewed by those they have been reared
with. The pups were separated into four groups at birth: siblings reared
together, siblings reared apart, non-siblings reared together and non-siblings
reared apart. The frequency of agonistic interactions in a closed environment
between two older squirrels was almost entirely dependent on whether they had
been reared together. However, there was also a small relatedness effect, and
in a separate experiment, year-old full sisters were less aggressive towards
each other, and more co-operative, than half-sisters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The previous two methods for guessing relatedness use
contingent, non-genetic cues based on social context. Hamilton�s initial paper
anticipated that phenotypic clues would play an important role. Indeed, humans
rely to some extent on visible similarity between relatives, but this only
really works at all for very close relatives. Some other explanation is
required to explain how animals are able to recognise kin to some degree even
without experience with parents or siblings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hamilton considered what is now jokingly known as the �green
beard� effect, where a gene codes for a highly noticeable phenotypic signal,
such as a green beard, as well as coding in altruism for anyone else with a
green beard. Such green bearded altruists would thrive as a group, and the
genes would quickly proliferate amongst kin members. Assuming that each family
could lay claim to one or more such distinguishing features, it would be very
easy to tell who is related to whom, and maybe even the degree of relatedness
according to the shade of green. Of course, such an effect would eventually be
subject to deception. For instance, if a gene were to code for a green beard
without the altruism, then another non-kin member of the species could
free-ride on his fellow greenbeards, and the usual animal deception cycle would
result. However, the green beard effect has been largely dismissed as a serious
explanation for kin recognition, since it requires a single gene to perform
both of two very dissimilar functions. Though green bearded mutants might not
be considered particularly unlikely, without the altruism towards other green
beards, the system would not operate as a marker for kin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One emerging candidate for identifying kin is based around
the Major Histocompatibility Complex. This is the genetic region found in
vertebrates best known for mediating cell-cell recognition, enabling the body
to distinguish and fight off foreign proteins, usually germs and viruses, and
more troublesomely for modern medicine, transplants. Containing 74 genes in
humans, many with extreme variability (up to 60 alleles in some loci), the
MHC<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>can give rise to an enormous range
of genotypes. Behaviour ecologists first started to take note of the MHC in
relation to kin recognition after results from the Sloan Kettering Institute
started to show that mice may employ a unique phenotypic signal based on the
MHC in mate preference. In mice, this discrimination is based (at least in
part) on a urinary odor cue, and in humans sweat also appears to play a role in
the chemical source of the signal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such a cue could be used in a number of ways (Lenington,
1994). It could be used to identify kin � indeed, female mice are more likely
to nest communally with females that are the same at the MHC than with females
that differ in MHC genes. It may be used in individual recognition, for example
in �pregnancy blocking� or aborting litters when female mice are exposed to
strange males who differ in their MHC from the stud male. It could also be used
to avoid in-breeding, as their early results suggested � mice preferred to mate
with mice that differed at the MHC rather than with mice that had the same MHC,
even when genetic background was controlled (Yamazaki et al., 1976).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The role of the MHC as a means of assessing the genetic
similarity between two individuals appears to outweigh the effect of the entire
remaining genetic background (Brown &amp; Eklund, 1994). As the potential ways
in which it might be employed listed above show, it might be employed both in
recognising individuals and quantifying overall genetic similarity (with
reference to one�s own MHC phenotypic signals). However, most of the work so
far has centred around mice, with some on rats and humans, but further studies
are required on other species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hamilton�s main thesis appears correct: genes express a
predisposition towards other animals on the basis of genetic similarity in a
number of ways. There is no single means by which animals recognise kin,
although they appear to employ a mixture of social context and phenotypic
clues. Because such clues may be open to deception, certainty plays as much of
a role as actual relatedness in mediating behaviour towards kin.</p>
