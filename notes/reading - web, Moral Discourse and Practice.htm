<h2>Notes � McDowell, �Values and secondary qualities�</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>values are analogous to secondary qualities, enough so for
us to acknowledge their reality, as colours are mind-dependent yet real</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>McDowell
thinks it is important to pay attention to the �lived character of evaluative
thought or discourse�, i.e. ordinary evaluative thought has a phenomenology of
being a sensitivity to aspects of the world<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not, as non-cognitivists would suggest, that we look
at the neutral world and then experience internal feelings or reactions to the
world. Actions and events in the world present themselves to us as being good
or bad in themselves. Mackie thinks that this experience of the world is an
illusion. However, McDowell wants to say that our moral experience can indeed
provide us with moral knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How/where do we get this impression of the world as being
�morally loaded�? Do we have some kind of perception of the moral? Mackie
assumed that if this was the case, that such moral perception would have to be
of the primary qualities of objects � which would be very mysterious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why can't moral perception be of secondary qualities? Mackie
would say that this is of no help to the moral cognitivist, because our
knowledge of secondary qualities is illusory as well. There are not really any colours
in the world; we just think there are because our minds make it looks as if the
world is coloured. We project colour onto the world, but science tells us that colours
are not really intrinsic properties of physical objects. McDowell thinks Mackie
is mistaken about our knowledge of secondary qualities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Red is a secondary quality. An object is red if it looks red
under certain circumstances. Red objects may not look red under certain sorts
of light, or in the dark. &quot;Red&quot; does not mean having certain
microscopic properties, although it may be that an object is red in virtue of
having such properties. Redness refers to how an object looks to us. Red
objects look as if they genuinely possess the property of being red. When we
look at a tomato, we do not normally think of the experience as if we are
looking at a colourless object that is causing us to have red experiences. We
think of the tomato as red, independently of our experience of it. McDowell wants
to say our normal way of thinking is correct here: a tomato really <i>is</i>
red, it is not just a matter of <i>looking</i> red.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie thinks that tomatoes are not really red, although
they really are round - experience of the roundness of the tomato resembles the
actual roundness of the tomato (Locke). McDowell suggests that the idea that
our experience of redness could resemble the actual redness of the tomato is
incoherent. (The argument will be that Mackie is wrong in saying that our
experience of redness fails to resemble the actual redness of the tomato,
because we can't even make sense of what this would be. It is not like saying
that a portrait fails to resemble the actual person depicted). To be coherent,
it would require:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>that
     we could conceive of colour as we can conceive of shape, as making sense
     independently of how things look. Objects have a certain shape which is
     independent of how they look to people. Colours are not like that. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo11;tab-stops:list .5in'>that
     we could make sense of the idea of a primary quality of an object resembling
     our experience of it, e.g., the redness of the tomato resembling our
     experience of its redness. </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell does not think that (ii) is possible. It would
require us to conceive of redness independently of how red things look. We have
no idea how else we might conceive of redness.(???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell agrees that secondary qualities are subjective in
the sense that we cannot understand the concept of them without reference to
our own subjective experience. But he says that they are not subjective in
these sense that they are figments of our experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In understanding our experience, we need to focus on its
content (�intentional object�). Then, if an experience is veridical, the
intentional object of the experience does not resemble the thing in the world;
it simply is the thing in the world �</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>this seems <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>very</i> dodgy??? surely, an intentional mental object shouldn't ever
be described as being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>identical</i> with
what relates to in the world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is part of a more general view that we actually manage
to think about things in the world, and not just our ideas of them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell does not want to give up distinguishing between
primary and secondary qualities, but he cannot distinguish between them on the
basis of the resemblance (or lack of it) between a quality and our idea of that
quality</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell wants to keep hold of the view that primary
qualities are distinctive in being both objective and perceptible. In order to
do this, he says we need to give up a view about what it is for a quality to
figure in experience. <span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>It
cannot be for the experience to have a certain intrinsic feature. Colours and
shapes figure in experience simply as properties that objects are represented
as having, distinctively phenomenal in the one case, and not so in the other.
Then</span> colours and shapes are equally real, although colours are
intrinsically phenomenal qualities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>McDowell
says that his position does not have to reject the idea that an experience
intrinsic features, but that there are good reasons to reject the idea anyway.
He seems to be saying that the only features of an experience are its
representational features. [This view is hardest to defend for experiences that
do not seem to contain representations of anything, such as pains, itches, and
the colors you see when you press your eyeballs.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>summary so far:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Mackie thought that in fact only the
Scientific Image is true, and the Manifest Image contains a great deal of
illusion. McDowell argues that this picture of our relation to reality makes it
hard to explain how we have any subjective or phenomenal knowledge of
scientific properties. On McDowell's view, there is an essential subjectivity
to our experience, but at the same time, our experience is not (intrinsically)
misleading or inaccurate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Mackie
defended his view that there is no good reason to think that objective reality
contains colors by arguing that we can explain all our experience without
supposing that colors objectively exist. This was generalized to skepticism
about any objective properties which resemble our ideas of secondary qualities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves the question for McDowell whether irreducibly
subjective features can be a part of the world. His argument is not that we
need these features to explain our experience, but that someone explaining our
experience cannot consistently deny the existence of irreducible subjectivity.
He concedes that it would be implausible to suggest that values have a causal
influence on the world. Furthermore, there is a crucial disanalogy between
values and secondary qualities. We see something as red if it is disposed to
look red to us. We see something as good if it tends to look virtuous to us.
But there is more to virtue than that: A virtue does not just <i>cause</i> our
approval of it: it <i>deserves</i> our approval</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell elaborates this point with the example of danger.
We fear something if it is dangerous. <span style='color:red'>Our fear is not
just <i>caused</i> by the dangerous thing, it is <i>justified</i> by it</span>.
The explanation of our color experience is different from our explanation of
our fear. We want to <i>make sense </i>of the fear. The best way of doing this
is to say that <span style='color:red'>the object feared is objectively (in the
sense of really, not as an opposite to subjectively) dangerous</span> (or
fearful, as McDowell says).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, we can best explain some of our other beliefs and
behavior by saying that some things really have value. If we try to do without
values in our explanations of our responses to the world, our explanations will
be less intelligible. [Why? Presumably a lot of weight rests on the analogy
with secondary qualities such as color. It is less easy to make sense of our
experience if we suppose the objects in the world have no color. We can talk
about what color an object really is, and of people being more or less able to
tell what color it is. Similarly, it is harder to explain our behavior if we
don't allow that some things are really dangerous, and of some people's ability
to discern danger.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We improve ourselves through better understanding of
ourselves and the world. Just as we can talk of the real color of an object, we
can talk of the real value of an action, and of the variation in different
people's ability to understand that value. There will of course be disagreement
about values, but that does not invalidate the argument. In a footnote,
McDowell says that the contentiousness of values may be ineliminable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell is ready to concede that values depend on us as
much as colors do, but insists that this does not impugn their reality. But
colors, danger, and values all help to explain our experience and responses to
the world. They are mind-dependent but still real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell considers how his view differs from projectivism,
which says that values are not real, but that we can explain our behavior
because we think that they are real. He says that projectivism relies on a thin
conception of reality, with no justification for doing so (???).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Furthermore,
the justification of value-responses depends on their functionality. Whether
something is functional depends on a value judgment, and according to the
projectivist, this is a projection of internal approval. The projectivist
mechanism must contemplate itself. This tends towards a systematic theoretical
approach to value. But McDowell thinks that some cases will forever remain
contentious, not capturable in a theory. His approach to value allows for more
of a patchwork of values.</span></p>

margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>but in contrast, we can't even
understand the concept of amusement without thinking of it as a reaction to the
object of our amusement. That is to say, we can't understand the concept of the
internal &quot;feeling&quot; without referring to something outside the person.
Or to put it another way, &quot;amusement&quot; is not a feeling in the same
way that disgust is a feeling. Presumably the feeling of disgust can be
described in non-circular ways without referring to something outside the
person</p>

true, if there were no way to rank different people's judgments of funniness in
terms of their justification. If we can rank different judgments of funniness,
then we can explain this by saying it is possible to understand what it is for
something to be really funny, and different judgments exhibit greater or less
of this understanding. (Remember that McDowell is not committed to comic
judgments actually being capable of truth-value. He is just supposing that they
are for the sake of argument.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Notes � Railton, �Moral realism�</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>general strategy in arguing for moral realism is to say that
we can best explain some people's behavior by referring to moral reality, i.e.,
what is actually good or bad</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>main opponent he faces is someone
who replies that we never need to refer to moral reality in explaining people's
behavior (Ockham�s razor), and that we can always explain behavior just as well
by reference to people's psychological states and non-moral facts about their
environment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moral realism in which moral judgments are objective
although relational, and have a truth value (cognitivism) except when indeterminate</p>

our moral beliefs are wrong. Some people may have a reason not to be moral.

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3>McDowell</h3>

<h4>Values and secondary qualities</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>is a 'secondary property' a purely extensional property,
i.e. it points out things that all seem red to us, without making any
(intensional) claims about what they have in common, why they seem red to us,
or what it is to be 'red'???</p>

<h4>Projectivism and truth in ethics</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>does McDowell call his own theory (a form of) projectivism???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>he considers his view to be similar,
but importantly different from, Blackburn�s, right???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>but he and Wiggins are more or less
in harmony, right???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if the no-priority view is that we explain our judgments by
reference to other similar judgments, doesn't that amount to a sort of
coherentism about value judgements</p>
