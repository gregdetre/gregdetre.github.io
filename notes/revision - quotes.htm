<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;In
all things, therefore, where we have clear evidence from our ideas, and those
principles of knowledge I have above mentioned, reason is the proper judge; and
revelation, though it may, in consenting with it, confirm its dictates, yet
cannot in such cases invalidate its decrees: nor can we be obliged, where we
have the clear and evident sentience of reason, to quit it for the contrary
opinion, under a pretence that it is matter of faith: which can have no
authority against the plain and clear dictates of reason.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what person stands for; which, I think, is a thinking
intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as
itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places; which it does
only by that consciousness which is inseparable from thinking, and, as it seems
to me, essential to it: It being impossible for any one to perceive, without
perceiving that he does perceive. When we see, hear, smell, taste, feel,
meditate, or will any thing, we know that we do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is
that which makes every one to be what he calls self, and thereby distinguishes
himself from all other thinking things; in this alone consists personal
identity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being: And as far as this
consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought, so far
reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now it was then; and
it is by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that
action was done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For as far as any intelligent being can repeat the idea of
any past action with the same consciousness it had of it at first, and with the
same consciousness it has of any present action: So far it is the same personal
selfAnd to punish Socrates waking for what sleeping Socrates thought, and
waking Socrates was never conscious of; would be no more of right, than to
punish one twin for what his brother-twin did, whereof he knew nothing, because
their outsides were so like, that they could not be distinguished; for such
twins have been seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>suppose I wholly lose the memory of some parts of my life
beyond a possibility of retrieving them, so that perhaps I shall never be
conscious of them againif it be possible for the same man to have distinct
incommunicable consciousness at different times, it is past doubt the same man
would at different times make different personshuman laws not punishing the mad
man for the sober man's actions, nor the sober man for what the mad man did,
thereby making them two personsWhy else is he punished for the fact he commits
when drunk, though he be never afterwards conscious of it? Human laws punish
both, with a justice suitable to their way of knowledge; because in these
cases, they cannot distinguish certainly what is real, what counterfeitBut in
the great day, wherein the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open, it may be
reasonable to think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing
of; but shall receive his doom, his conscience accusing or excusing him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For whatsoever any substance has thought or done, which I
cannot recollect, and by my consciousness make my own thought and action, it
will no more belong to me, whether a part of me thought or did it, than if it
had been thought or done by any other immaterial being anywhere existing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any thing united to it by a consciousness of former actions,
makes also a part of the same self, which is the same both then and now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Person, as I take it, is the name for this self. Wherever a
man finds what he calls himself, there I think another may say is the same
person. It is a forensick term appropriating actions and their merit; and so
belongs only to intelligent agents capable of a law, and happiness and misery.
This personality extends itself beyond present existence to what is past, only
by consciousness, whereby it becomes concerned and accountable, owns and imputes
to itself past actions, just upon the same ground, and for the same reason that
it does the present. All which is founded in a concern for happiness, the
unavoidable concomitant of consciousnessFor supposing a man punished now for
what he had done in another life, whereof he could be made to have no
consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and
being created miserable?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;receive according to his doings, the secrets of all
hearts shall be laid open.&quot; The sentence shall be justified by the
consciousness all persons shall have, that they themselves, in what bodies
soever they appear, or what substances soever that consciousness adheres to,
are the same that committed those actions, and deserve that punishment for
them.</p>

<h5><u>From Sarah W's excerpts 2<o:p></o:p></u></h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>The perception of ideas being (as I conceive) to the soul,
what motion is to the body: Not its essence, but one of its operations. And
therefore, though thinking be supposed never so much the proper action of the
soul, yet it is not necessary to suppose that it should be always thinking,
always in action</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span>I do not say there
is no soul in a man, because he is not sensible of it in his sleep: But I do
say, he cannot think at any time, waking or sleeping, without being sensible of
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>waking man, whereof the sleeping man is never conscious, has
never the least perception. I ask then, whether Castor and Pollux, thus, with
only one soul between them, which thinks and perceives in one what the other is
never conscious of, nor is concerned for, are not two as distinct persons as
Castor and Hercules, or as Socrates and Plato were? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For I suppose nobody will make identity of persons to
consist in the soul's being united to the very same numerical particles of
matter: For if that be necessary to identity, it will be impossible, in that
constant flux of the particles of our bodies, that any man should be the same
person two days, or two moments together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To think often, and never to retain it so much as one
moment, is a very useless sort of thinking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is altogether as intelligible to say, that a body is
extended without parts, as that any thing thinks without being conscious of it,
or perceiving that it does so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they say, that a man is always conscious to himself of
thinking, I ask, how they know it. Consciousness is the perception of what
passes in a man's own mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Revelation
in matters where reason cannot judge, or but probably, ought to be hearkened
to. First, Whatever proposition is revealed, of whose truth our mind, by its
natural faculties and notions, cannot judge, that is purely matter of faith,
and above reason.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Truth,
then, seems to me, in the proper import of the word, to signify nothing but the
joining or separating of Signs, as the Things signified by them do agree or
disagree one with another. The joining or separating of signs here meant, is
what by another name we call proposition. So that truth properly belongs only
to propositions: whereof there are two sorts, viz. mental and verbal; as there
are two sorts of signs commonly made use of, viz. ideas and words.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>&quot;Our
knowledge of our own existence is intuitive. As for our own existence, we
perceive it so plainly and so certainly, that it neither needs nor is capable
of any proof... I think, I reason, I feel pleasure and pain: can any of these
be more evident to me than my own existence?... For if I know I feel pain, it
is evident I have as certain perception of my own existence, as of the
existence of the pain I feel: or if I know I doubt, I have as certain perception
of the existence of the thing doubting, as of that thought which I call doubt.
Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive knowledge of our own
existence, and an internal infallible perception that we are. In every act of
sensation, reasoning, or thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our own
being; and, in this matter, come not short of the highest degree of
certainty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>To
show, therefore, that we are capable of knowing, i.e. being certain that there
is a God, and how we may come by this certainty, I think we need go no further
than ourselves, and that undoubted knowledge we have of our own existence...
For man knows that he himself exists... If any one pretends to be so sceptical
as to deny his own existence, (for really to doubt of it is manifestly
impossible,) let him for me enjoy his beloved happiness of being nothing, until
hunger or some other pain convince him of the contrary... He knows also that
nothing cannot produce a being; therefore something must have existed from
eternity... Next, it is evident, that what had its being and beginning from
another, must also have all that which is in and belongs to its being from
another too. All the powers it has must be owing to and received from the same
source. This eternal source, then, of all being must also be the source and
original of all power; and so this eternal Being must be also the most
powerful... And most knowing. Again, a man finds in himself perception and
knowledge. We have then got one step further; and we are certain now that there
is not only some being, but some knowing, intelligent being in the world. There
was a time, then, when there was no knowing being, and when knowledge began to
be; or else there has been also a knowing being from eternity...And therefore
God.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
