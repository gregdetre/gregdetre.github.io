<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is rationality? � Nagel�s objectivist position</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel defines rationality as the capacity �to recognise
objectively valid reasons and arguments�. He is a realist about reason and does
not want to accept reductive interpretations of it is as a �contingent though
basic feature of a particular culture or form of life�. He recognises that he
needs to address the question of how it is that contingent, biological
creatures such as ourselves can have access to such universally valid methods
of objective thought. I want to focus on the extent to which evolutionary
theory supports or undermines such rational objectivism, as I will term Nagel�s
position. </p>

<h3>What is evolutionary theory?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory (or
�neo-Darwinism�) is the principle of natural selection, whereby parental characteristics
that vary across organisms play a role in non-random differential reproduction.
That is, �adaptive� variations (i.e. enhance �fitness�) are those which increase
an organism�s (probabilistic) propensity to survive and reproduce. This process
gradually gives rise to diverse forms leading ultimately, through selective
adaptation to specific niches and environments, to the emergence of new species.
If humans are the end-product of a natural, non-teleological process of <span
class=crossref>evolution</span> that has resulted in the particular, contingent
bodies and brains that we have, then our reasoning abilities and limitations will
be explicable in terms of evolutionary theory too.</p>

<h2>Main</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Curiously, evolutionary
theory has been employed by both objectivists and subjectivists to support
their claims. For example, Stich cites Quine, Dennett and Fodor as implying that
evolution selects for rationality and that irrationality is empirically
impossible or unlikely</span>, e.g.:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>creatures inveterately wrong in
their inductions have a pathetic but praiseworthy tendency to die out before
reproducing their kind.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, Pinker and others have argued that the opposite is the
case, i.e. that evolved creatures (including ourselves) are highly unlikely to
be rational. I will start by reviewing how objectivists try and use
evolutionary theory to directly support their claim, and then consider how it
can also be employed by the subjectivists. Even though I think that the
empirical psychological and biological evidence clearly undermines the
objectivists, Nagel argues that such evidence belongs to the family of
arguments that can be attacked as self-defeating. Unfortunately, if we accept his
argument, he leaves us in a position analagous to the �explanatory gap� in
philosophy of mind, where hard science is unable to incorporate how things
clearly seem to us to be into its explanation.</p>

<h2>Can evolutionary theory be used to support objectivism? (Stich)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stich considers that there are two main reasons why people
think that evolution insures rationality:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l10 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>Evolution
     produces organisms with good approximations to optimally well-designed
     characteristics or systems</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l10 level1 lfo16;tab-stops:list .5in'>An
     optimally well-designed cognitive system is a rational cognitive system</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>He systematically takes apart both of these premises. His
aim is not to demonstrate conclusively that evolution theory is incompatible
with rational objectivism, but merely to show that the rational objectivists
have their work cut out in showing how the two can sit together. I will not
consider the arguments in as much detail, but I will try and recount, evaluate
and supplement them to a limited extent.</p>

<h3>Does evolution produce near-optimal systems?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The notions of �fitness� and �optimality� are central to any
evolutionary theory. A system is �well-designed� if it enhances biological fitness
(likelihood to survive and reproduce successfully) more than any alternative. Of
course, this is problematic because of the difficulties of deciding what counts
as an alternative. No doubt a predator which had evolved a high velocity rifle as
an extra limb would be at an enormous evolutionary advantage, but as I will
discuss below, the march of evolution is restricted to a sequence of gradual
changes, each adaptive in their own right � although the end result of a fully-functional
rifle would be highly adaptive, all of the intermediary stages (growing a long,
perfectly straight, protruding barrel, the combustion mechanism, an organ for ammunition
manufacture etc.) would be highly maladaptive right up until they were all
brought together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stich considers a number of technical arguments against a na�
faith in evolution as an infallible optimiser. He points out that natural
selection is not the only process that causes changes of gene frequency in
populations (which is how biologists define evolution). Mutation, migration and
random drift all affect gene frequencies, to a greater or lesser degree. For
instance, a random event or disaster might wipe out a large proportion of a
population, including all the carriers of a particular fit gene, allowing a
less fit gene to take hold in the population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Natural selection does not necessarily choose the best genes
in the gene pool anyway � Stich discusses meiotic drive, the effect of combined
recessive genes, pleiotropy and heterozygote superiority. Each of these phenomena
can lead to less optimal members of the available gene pool being selected for.
In the case of meiotic drive, for example, �certain genes have the capacity to
�cheat� in meiosis [�the process that produces sperm and eggs�] and end up
significantly over-represented in the sperm or eggs�, and so �obviously, such a
gene will spread quickly through a population, even if the phenotypic effects
of the gene are harmful�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to emphasise a deeper problem about evolution
for objectivists that Stich touches on. Evolution is not teleological � it does
not modity towards an end-goal, but by producing various slightly different
incarnations, each one a little bit more or a little bit less adaptive than its
parents. Most modern biologists are gradualists, that is, they believe that a
host of these tiny changes amount to large-scale improvements in the organisms,
like a new organ. In contrast, saltatory explanation holds that sudden, marked
�leaps� (macro-mutations) drive evolution forwards. Assuming the gradualists to
be correct, evolution suffers from what artificial intelligence researchers
term the �hill-climbing problem�. In outline, this considers that the space of
possibilities which evolution is exploring through natural selection working on
population variation can be visualised as a landscape, in which the hills and
mountains represent more optimal designs. If the mechanism of evolution
progresses incrementally, visualisable as travelling in a continuous path
uphill, then a population may become stranded on a nearby hill, unable to
traverse to the nearby mountain (an optimal design) which is separated by a
valley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel rightly states that �the essential characteristic of
reasoning is its generality�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Nagel is certainly not content to regard his rational capacity as forming beliefs
that are merely relative, true for a New Yorker, true for an American, true for
a human even. He seeks to defend reason as a universal source of authority. In
order to do that, surely our inferential system needs to have evolved to be
absolutely optimal. If it was merely very well-designed, it might be able to
generalise well, but not generalise to �objectively valid� conclusions. Its
conclusions might be much less subjective than a less well-designed system, but
still not entirely generalisable. Given how unlikely it is that any evolved
system is ever wholly optimal, does this mean that we there is no hope that we
could be rational in the way that Nagel envisages? I think that the answer to
this is probably �no�. In the discussion above, Cherniak showed that there is a
scale of rationality, and that Nagel�s requirements for objective rationality place
him at the high end, but not the top of that scale, requiring a high level, but
not maximum, optimality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Lastly, it is necessary
to show that our cognitive system is a product of biological evolution. After
all, �even if it were the case that natural selection is a flawless optimiser
and that it is the only cause of biological evolution, it would still not
follow that our system of inferential strategies is optimally well-designed�
unless �evolutionary factors are the only [or major] ones that have shaped our
current inferential strategies�. </span>In order for natural selection to shape
a characteristic, there must be variation in the population that affects
reproductive success in a systematic way, and this variation must be under
genetic control either directly or indirectly. He considers clothing styles and
language as examples in which there is great diversity within the human population,
that may have some impact on fitness, but this diversity is not genetically
based. �Had I been born elsewhere, I would now have the ability to speak Lapp
or Korean rather than English.� And the processes by which languages spread are
almost entirely independent of biological evolution, depending far more on
social and historical factors, for example. Similarly, it may be that �the [inferential]
strategies a person employs, like the language he/she speaks, are determined in
large measure by environmental variables�.</p>

<h3>Is an optimal system necessarily a rational one?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming that the objectivist could show that evolution produces
near-optimal systems, the crucial second step necessary to show that evolution
selects for rational systems is to show that an optimal system is a rational
one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analytic epistemology is the approach of analysing our
ordinary concepts </p>

<h2>What sort of less objectivist account of rationality does evolutionary
theory provide? (Stich + Nozick), i.e. what sort of inferential system is it
likely that evolution has left us with?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nozick�s account supplements Stich�s arguments nicely. He
sees the relationship between evolution and rationality as informing problems
aired by Descartes and Hume. Hume�s problem of induction addressed the
impossibility of finding a rational (deductive) argument for why (inductive)
reasoning works. Descartes questioned why self-evident propositions, as
discerned by the natural light of reason, must correspond to reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After all, if reason and the facts are independent
variables, why should they be correlated at all? Kant responded that since we
cannot show why our reason would conform to objects, it must be that we
perceive the objects to be the way they are because they are constructed by our
faculties. In other words, our knowledge is not of things in themselves, but
only of an empirical reality shaped by our constitution. Kant termed this
upheaval a �Copernican revolution�, although confusingly, in contrast to
Copernicus� effect on astronomy, Kant is reaffirming an anthropomorphic perspective
on the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Nozick is
overturning the </span>Kantian dependence of the facts on reason<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>. His �evolutionary hypothesis� amounts to
saying that it is reason that is the dependent variable, shaped by the facts. Our
inferential system has evolved to become specialised for common past situations
and stabilities in our environment. He suggests that there was selection for
recognising as valid certain kinds of connections that are factual, which come to
seem to us as more than just factual. Thus, the neural architecture for a given
factual connection that appears regularly and stably in our environment may be
modified over evolutionary time so that our descendants learn it faster. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, �reason tells us about reality, because reality shapes
reason, selecting for what seems �evident��. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>However, just because a certain factual connection has been consistent
in the past and we have evolved to see it as a vaild and increasingly
self-evident basis for inference, does not guarantee that it will continue to
hold in the future. </span>Moreover, the question is not just whether the
stable regularities of the past continue to hold in the future, but also
whether evolution has picked out the �right� regularities or given us �green�
in a �grue� world. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>We may come to see
the given sequence of thought as increasingly self-evidently certain (because
we are selected to do so, because in a stable world such semi-automatic
inference-making is adaptive), but this does not guarantee that it ever was
strictly true.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Importantly then, he is not saying that it is the capacity
to recognise independently existing valid rational connections that is selected
for. Rationality can be seen as a biological adaptation with a function. It was
never the function of rationality to justify certain of our most basic, stable,
useful assumptions, because all we needed was to utilise them as trust-worthy,
predictive regularities. These basic, sub-rational assumptions include the list
of philosophical problems we�ve been least successful with: the problems of
induction; of other minds; of the external world; and of justifying rationality.<span
style='color:red'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It initially seems as though this wholly undermines any
claims to objectivity through reason, though in fact Nozick is keen to defend
against seeing this as the consequence of his arguments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may still be able to sharpen our goals and procedures
though, at least to some extent. Evolutionary theorising may help us understand
what sort of rational system would be adaptive, and consequently why our
rational system is the way it is. The fact that rationality wasn�t designed to
justify itself or its framework assumptions does not mean that it can�t, or
that we can�t turn our rationality upon itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Rationality is self-conscious,
in that it attempts to correct biases in the information it is supplied, and in
its processes of reasoning. Nozick claims that �Whatever the initial functions
of reasons were, we can use our ability to employ reasons to formulate new
properties of reasons and to shape our utilisation of reasons to exhibit these
properties. We can, that is, modify and alter the functions of reasons, and
hence of rationality.�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After all, although psychological experiments show how often
most people fail to reason well, for example about probability, the very fact
that we have been able (through centuries of reflection) to formalise and so
correct such faulty reasoning lends hope to improving upon <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>these biologically-instilled assumptions,
e.g. Euclidean geometry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>What can the objectivist reply to the subjectivising arguments of
evolutionary theory?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Nozick is stresses that his evolutionary account of
why we find certain thought processes rationally self-evident does not provide
a reason-independent justification of reason. Rather, it is part of our
current, ongoing scientific view, and not part of first philosophy.</p>
