<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The frontal lobe has long been ascribed higher, intellectual or executive functions � this tradition can be traced back to the well-known 1848 case of Phineas Gage (from Damasio, 1994). After miraculously surviving an iron rod passing straight through his skull, Gage was transformed as a person. The rod caused most damage to his left frontal lobe, and left the formerly religious, friendly and competent foreman unable to hold down a job, disreputable and prone to inappropriate swearing and social behaviour.</p>
<p>what makes humans special, different and at an advantage is our ability to store and process sensory information, so that we use it better in making effecitve responses to our environment</p>
<p>not only has our neocortex grown through evolution, but the proportions have changed radically</p>
<p>very little of a rat�s cortex is not either primary motor or a projection area for one of the senses</p>
<p>by contrast: in humans, most of the cortex neither reponds in an obvious way to simple sensory stimulation, nor produces movements when electrically activated (= �silent areas�)</p>
<p>large number of diverse + seemingly unrelated facts � apparently multiple functions � but the basic funcitons seem to be essentially few, and are represented over the cortical surface according to a certain topological pattern</p>
<p>interrelated, mutually supporting and complementing functions in the purposive behaviour of the organism</p>
<p>prefrontal � ugly, misuses �pre�, aka frontal granular cortex (cytoarchitectonic features in primates) and frontal association cortex (ambiguities of the word �association�)</p>
<p>often referred to as �frontal�, implicitly excluding the motor and premotor areas</p>
<p>in rodents and carnivores, is also called the �orbitofrontal cortex�, easily confused with �orbital frontal cortex� (which in primates = the ventral aspect of the frontal lobe which forms part of the prefrontal cortex)</p>
<p>primates: cerebral cortex of both hemispheres is divided by the central sulcus (Rolandic fissure) into 2:</p>
<p><em>posterior</em> � sensation, perception, perceptual memory</p>
<p><em>frontal</em> � action and motor memory</p>
<p>both are hierarchically organised in terms of development, connectivity, memory and processing of sensory and motor information</p>
<h2 id="main">Main</h2>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-the-frontal-lobes">Anatomy of the frontal lobes</h3>
<p>The frontal lobe includes all the tissue in front of the central sulcus (approximately 20% of the entire neocortex), and can be divided functionally into three main categories: the motor, premotor and prefrontal.</p>
<p>There are parallel cortical motor systems for movements of the limbs and eyes. There are also two premotor systems, both with a map of the whole body. These play a role in the selection of movements, and differ in their reliance on information about the external context.</p>
<h5 id="motor-area-4">motor (area 4)</h5>
<p>The motor cortex (Brodmann�s area 4) </p>
<p>the motor cortex is specialised for the control of the movements of limb and face (�manipulative movements�).</p>
<p>it is not essential for the control of non-learned movements, such as reaching and walking</p>
<p>although motor cortex is active during the normal performance of such movements, subcortical mechanisms have some control over them even in the absence of motor cortex</p>
<p>motor cortex provides a mechanism for the execution of the fine behavioural variants which are selected in voluntary action</p>
<p>the ability to perform discrete movements depends on the direct connections from motor cortex to the motor neurons in the spinal cord</p>
<h5 id="premotor-areas-6-8">premotor (areas 6 + 8)</h5>
<p>premotor cortex - lateral area 6</p>
<p>lateral premotor area has expanded as Broca�s area (44) has developed</p>
<p>Like the lateral premotor cortex, the medial premotor cortex plays a role in the selection of movement;</p>
<p>but the two areas differ in their specialisation. The lateral premotor cortex makes the greater contribution when the subject uses external cues to direct the movements, and the medial premotor cortex when no such cues are available. However, the specialisation is a matter of degree � it is by no means total.</p>
<p>The evidence comes from the analysis of the effects of lesions, from PET scanning and from unit recording. Considering first tasks with no external cues, monkeys with MPC but not LPC lesions are severely impaired at performing self-paced arm movements, and at relearning motor sequences. This contrasts with the pattern of results for tasks on which performance is directed by external cues. Monkeys� with LPC but not MPC lesions are impaired at relearning a visual conditional motor task, and monkeys with MPC lesions are only slightly impaired at making arm movements cued by an external signal.</p>
<p>In PET scanning experiments, the medial premotor cortex is activated when subjects perform a well-rehearsed sequence from memory, but there is more activation in the lateral premotor cortex when subjects must rely on external feedback to learn new sequences.</p>
<p>Recordings from single cells in monkeys show the same pattern. More cells are active in the medial premotor cortex when repetitive movements are self-paced, and in the lateral premotor cortex when these movements are externally triggered. Similarly, more cells are active in the medial premotor cortex when the animals perform motor sequences from memory and in the lateral premotor cortex when they learn new sequences as directed by visual cues.</p>
<p>supplementary motor cortex - medial area 6</p>
<p>frontal eye field � area 8</p>
<p>Motor cortex governs movements of the limbs and face ,and the frontal eye fields the movements of the eyes. Just as the selection of limb and face movements depends on the premotor mechanisms of area 6, so the selection of eye movments depends on the premotor mechanims of the rest of area 8. Both monkeys and patients with lesions in lateral area 8 are poor at directing their eye on the basis of a learned context.</p>
<p>The selection of eye movements is to be described in terms of the objects of the search, the things or locations that we look for. Whereas area 6 selects our limb movements, area 8 selects things in the outside world. It is for this reason that area 6 receives proprioceptive information, and area 8 information from the external senses.</p>
<p>Area 8 forms part of the lateral premotor cortex and the dorsomedial eye field part of the medial (supplementary) motor cortex. It is proposed that area 8 is specialised for the selection of eye movements made when targets have been presented and the dorsomedial eye field for the selection of eye movements that are not determined by visual targets.</p>
<p>supplementary eye field - area 8a</p>
<h3 id="frontal-lobes-overview-of-function">Frontal lobes � overview of function</h3>
<p>example of: shopping for various ingredients to cook a meal for friends after work in a hurry</p>
<p>frontal lobe injury cannot manage this. fundamental requirements are:</p>
<p>plan behaviour in advance, selecting from many options</p>
<p>time constraint, so ignore stimuli and persists in the taks at hand</p>
<p>keep track of where we have been and done</p>
<p>general function of the frontal lobe:</p>
<p>behavioural requirements = temporal organisation of behaviour</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-the-prefrontal">Anatomy of the prefrontal</h3>
<p>curious name � Rose + Woolsey�s observation that it received projections from the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus</p>
<h5 id="divisions-within-the-prefrontal">divisions within the prefrontal</h5>
<p>primates 3 regions:</p>
<p>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 9, 46)</p>
<p>Areas 9 and 46 receive their main input from the parietal lobe which processes information about the animal itself, and about the space in which it moves and manipulates things.</p>
<p>Monkeys with lesions in area 46 fail to learn delayed response tasks. These are conditional tasks on which the animal must choose between locations on the basis of information in working memory. These impairments can be demonstrated on an oculomotor version of the DR task on which monkeys must direct their eye movements on the basis of locations in which they recently saw a spot of light. During the delay on this task, many cells in area 46 change their activity selectively according to the location of the target.</p>
<p>Monkeys with lesions in area 9 and 46 are impaired at selecting between objects on the basis of their past responses, and also at generating a series of actions. In PET scanning expeirments with human subjects, the dorsal prefrontal cortex is activated when the subjects generate a series of actions at will. In patients there is also a relation between psychomotor retardation and a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow the dorsal prefrontal cortex. This suggests a role for the dorsal prefrontal cortex in generating actions.</p>
<p>inferior (or ventral) prefrontal cortex (areas 11, 12, 13, 14)</p>
<p>= orbital frontal cortex (11, 13, 14) because the orbit (socket) of the eye</p>
<p>The ventral prefrontal cortex receives a multimodal input from the temporal lobe. Monkeys are impaired at learning what response to make, irrespective of the modality of the cue. There is also evidence suggesting that it may not be essential that there is a delay between the presentation of the cue and the opportunity to respond; however, this evidence is not conclusive. It is argued that the ventral prefrontal cortex selects the goal � e.g. an object � given the current context.</p>
<p>When monkeys learn visual concurrent discriminations, they can solve the problems by learning only about the associations between the stimuli and reward. Monkeys with ventral prefrontal lesions can learn such problems at a normal rate. Furthermore, when human subjects make perceptual judgements, there is no activation in the prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>The ventral prefrontal cortex is heavily interconnected with the amygdala. Monkeys will learn to deliver rewarding stimulation to the orbital cortex or to deliver rewarding drugs. It is argued that the connections between the ventral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are involved in the process by which responses are selected on the basis of their success.</p>
<p>medial frontal cortex (areas 25, 32)</p>
<p>= sometimes considered part of the anterior cingulate region rather than prefrontal cortex</p>
<p>orbit(o)(al)(medial)etc. ???</p>
<p>the 2 multimodal areas of the frontal lobe = the lateral premotor cortex (area 6) and area 46</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is one of the most recently evolved and massively developed areas of the primate, and especially, human brain. </p>
<h3 id="connections-of-the-prefrontal-areas">Connections of the prefrontal areas</h3>
<p>prefrontal areas � endpoints of the dorsal + ventral visual streams</p>
<p>Felleman &amp; van Essen included the prefrontal as part of the visual cortex</p>
<p>dorsolateral prefrontal area (areas 9 + 46)</p>
<p>reciprocal connections with the posterior parietal areas and the superior temporal sulcus</p>
<p>extensive connections to the same areas the posterior parietal projects to, incl:</p>
<p>the cingulate cortex, basal ganglia and superior colliculus</p>
<p>inferior frontal area (areas 11-14)</p>
<p>receives its main afferents from:</p>
<p>the temporal lobe (incl the auditory regions of the superior temporal gyrus), the visual regions of TE, and the superior temporal sulcus, and amygdala</p>
<p>there are also connections from:</p>
<p>the somatosensory cortex (area 43), gustatory cortex (in the insula), and olfactory regions of the pyriform cortex</p>
<p>the gustatory + olfactory connections are localised in the orbital cortex</p>
<p>the visual, auditory + somatosensory connections go largely to area 12</p>
<p>projects subcortically to the amygdala and hypothalamus</p>
<p>this provides a route for influencing the autonomic system (important in emotional responses)</p>
<p>receive a significant input from dopaminergic cells in the tegmentum</p>
<p>(plays an important role in regulating how prefrontal neurons react to stimuli, incl stressful ones) � abnormalities in this projection play a central role in schizophrenia</p>
<p>frontal cortex has important connections with the basal ganglia</p>
<p>perhaps expected: basal ganglia lesions �/span&gt; similar spatial memory impairments</p>
<p>Ingle &amp; Hoff: frogs impaired in this way</p>
<p>visible barrier placed beside frog, then removed,</p>
<p>delay, then large dark object looms towards frog, which leaps away</p>
<p>normal frogs avoided leaping into or around the barrier�s previous location</p>
<p>frogs with basal ganglia lesions: behaved as if they failed to remember where the barrier had been, though they avoided it when it was present</p>
<p>diverse output:</p>
<p>extends to the hypothalamus as well as to the striatum, subthalamus and midbrain</p>
<p>receives afferents from:</p>
<p>the correspondingly large dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus</p>
<p>(which receives from the frontal lobe, but also the hypothalamus and other parts of the limbic system)</p>
<h3 id="functions-of-the-prefrontal-cortex">Functions of the prefrontal cortex</h3>
<p><em>prefrontal cortex</em> : controls the cognitive processes so that appropriate movements are selected at the correct time + place</p>
<p>this selection may be controlled by internalised information, or may be made in response to context</p>
<p>the internalised record of what has just occurred is independent of the existing sensory information = the STM</p>
<p>temporal memory = neural record of recent events</p>
<p>events = either things or places</p>
<p>thus information is derived from the object-recognition or spatial streams of sensory processing</p>
<p>(both project to the prefrontal cortex, though to different parts)</p>
<p>i.e. spatial + object information are stored in temporal memory � but localised in different places in the frontal cortex</p>
<p>dorsolateral areas = especially involved in the selection of behaviour based on temporal memory (if defective, become dependent on environmental cues)</p>
<p>so frontal lobe injury �/span&gt; difficulty inhibiting behaviour directed to external stimuli, as opposed to being controlled by internalised knowledge</p>
<p>behaviour = context-dependent</p>
<p>Goodall: the current make-up of the social group dictates the behaviour of each chimpanzee (e.g. bold + relaxed vs quiet + nervous with a different group of animals)</p>
<p>can be serious consequences in wrongly evaluating context</p>
<p>primates: highly social, hence the need for large frontal lobe</p>
<p>choice of behaviour in context requires detailed sensory information:</p>
<p>conveyed to the inferior frontal cortex from the temporal lobe</p>
<p>amygdala supplies the affective context</p>
<p>inferior frontal lesoins �/span&gt; difficulty with context, especially in social situations</p>
<h3 id="asymmetry-of-frontal-lobe-function">Asymmetry of frontal lobe function</h3>
<p>functional asymmetry in parietal + temporal association cortex � similar in frontal lobes</p>
<p>left: preferential role in language-related movements, incl speech</p>
<p>right: greater role in other movements, e.g. facial expression</p>
<p>however, both frontal lobes play roles in nearly all behavoiur</p>
<p>laterality of function = relative, not absolute</p>
<h3 id="lesions">Lesions</h3>
<h5 id="leucotomies-be">Leucotomies (B&amp;E)</h5>
<p>prefrontal lobotomies, pioneered by Moniz (Moniz, 1936; Fulton, 1951) � argued that anxiety, irrational fears and emotional hyperexcitabilty in humans might be treated by damage to the frontal lobes</p>
<p>widespread use of this procedure � although irrational anxiety or emotional outbursts were sometimes controlled � but intellectual deficits and other side effects were often apparent (Rylander, 1948; Valenstein, 1974)</p>
<p>still had pain, but it no longer bothered them (Freeman &amp; Watts, 1950; Melzack &amp; Wall, 1996)</p>

<p>frontal cortex = important for spatial discriminations</p>
<p>Nakamura � monkeys: spared all the visual areas of the posterior cortex, but removed all the cortex anterior to it</p>
<p>the monkeys failed to show any signs of vision, but recordings of single cell activity in the visual areas showed the cells to be functioning normally</p>
<p>i.e. removal of the frontal cortex �/span&gt; chronically blind, even though the visual system is functioning</p>
<p>restricted lesions in the visual cortex �/span&gt; more selective impairments:</p>
<p>Haaxma &amp; Kuypers: if the finger area of the motor cortex is disconnected from the visual centers</p>

<p>Goldman-Rakic: rhesus monkeys, lesions in the frontal cortex along the principal sulcus</p>
<p>the monkeys were trained to direct their gaze and fixate on a spot of light flashed in their visual field, once the spot had disappeared</p>
<p>unilateral lesions: could only direct their gaze to direct when no delay, not even with short delays</p>
<p>selective deficits in different parts of the visual field (by varying the location of the lesion)</p>

<p>As in monkeys, the prefrontal cortex is also crtiically involved in the process by which the human brian generates and selects actions. Human beings can select between ideas, and the prefrontal cortex has been elaborated to allow the selection of mental responses.</p>
<p>Human beings can also plan future actions and select between them by mental trial and error. The consequences of this development are far-reaching, because it means that human beings can set themselves goals other than simply promoting their genes in the next generation. Human beings are capable of �voluntary� action in the most restrictive sense.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex as a whole selects actions when the subject must make a new decision as to what to do. It is not yet clear whether prefrontal cortex is only engaged when there is no external cue at the time of the response.</p>
<p>If new decisions are required when a task is learned, prefrontal cortex is activated. But if the task can later be run off automatically, prefrontal cortex need no longer be engaged.</p>
<p>The exact role played by the basal ganglia is not clear. In animals without neocortex, such as amphibians, the basal ganglia form the telencephalic mechanism for determining responses. In mammals, the frontal cortical and basal ganglia are closely interrelated via a system of loops. There are suggestions that the ventral striatum may play a role in the process by which the probability of a response is altered as a result of positive or negative outcomes.</p>
<h5 id="neuroimaging-branching-study-in-nature">Neuroimaging branching study in nature</h5>
<p>Using imaging technology, scientists from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) found that a specific type of multitasking behavior, called <em>branching</em> , can be mapped to a certain region of the brain that is especially well developed in humans compared to other primates. The study will appear in the May 13, 1999, issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>.1</p>
<p>"The results of this study suggest that the anterior prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is most developed in humans, mediates the ability to depart temporarily from a main task in order to explore alternative tasks before returning to the main task at the departed point," says Jordan Grafman, Ph.D., Chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section at the NINDS and a co-author of the study.</p>
<p>The investigators used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures changes in blood flow to the brain, to view the brains of volunteers while they performed branching tasks. The region of the brain that is involved in multitasking is called the fronto-polar prefrontal cortex (FPPC).</p>
<p>Tasks performed by the volunteers involved exercises to test working memory, attentional focus, and a combination of the two. All of the subjects, who were healthy, normal volunteers, participated in all of the task groups. The task groups consisted of a control task, a delayed-response task, a dual-task, and a branching conditions task. Dual-task involves changing focus between alternative goals successively. The investigators predicted that subject performance on the individual delayed-response task and dual-task conditions would not activate the FPPC. They did predict that the branching task which involves problem solving and planning would stimulate activity in the FPPC. According to the fMRI data, their predictions were correct. The FPPC was activated only during those tasks that involved an interaction between working memory and attentional focus decisions.</p>
<p>The FPPC is the region of the brain that controls complex problem solving and is especially well developed in humans as compared to other primates. The study showed that the FPPC selectively mediates the human ability to multi-task.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="summary-of-prefrontal-functions">Summary of prefrontal functions</h3>
<p>frontal lobe � endpoint for the spatial and object-recognition functions initiated in the occiptal lobe</p>
<p>the frontal lobe�s function = to select behaviours with respect to context and internalised knowledge</p>
<p>3 distinct functional zones:</p>
<p>motor cortex � responsible for making movements</p>
<p>premotor cortex � selects movements</p>
<p>lateral � selects behaviours in response to environmental cues</p>
<p>supplementary � selects behvaiorus on the basis of internalised knowledge</p>
<p>prefrontal cortex � controls the cognitive processes so that appropriate movements are selected at the right time and place</p>
<p>dorsolateral zone � selects behvaoiur with respect to temporal memory</p>
<p>inferior � selects behaviour with respect to context (current + based on knowledge)</p>
<h3 id="unitary-function">Unitary function?</h3>
<p>whatever the criteria for tracing its boundaries, no demarcation can be said to outline a structural entity with unitary function</p>
<p>on morphological grounds alone: the anatomical complexity (especially in higher animals), makes its functional homogeneity implausible</p>
<p>behavioural study of animals with selective lesions of this cortex �/span&gt; rules out such homogenity</p>
<p>untiary role: also inconsistent with clinical findings in patients with injuries to this part of the brain</p>
<p>unitary function � but at different levels (Fuster, 1996)</p>
<p>�doer� cortex</p>
<p>organises action in the time domain</p>
<p>it is only with regard to this commonality of cognitive functions at the service of assorted actions that the prefrontal cortex may be considered functionally �homogenous�</p>
<p>only minor effect on ordinary intelligence, except:</p>
<p>difficulties in carrying out more than one program of activity simultaneously</p>
<p>inability to organise actions in proper temporal sequence, e.g. trying to prepare a meal</p>
<p>e.g. monkeys, delayed reaction test</p>
<p>monkey behind glass partition in cage</p>
<p>shown a reward in one of two boxes, then both closed</p>
<p>interval of 10 minutes � partition raised</p>
<p>normal monkeys go to the correct box to receive reward</p>
<p>frontal lesion animals: cannot, unless they spend the waiting period concentrating single-mindedly on the correct doors</p>
<p>unit recordings in prefrontal areas during delayed response trials indicate that these are areas are in some sense �waiting to do something�</p>
<p>activity in many units starts up on receipt of the command, then firing is sustained until the response is finally made</p>
<p>= defects in the ability to <em>store a program of action</em> for deferred use</p>
<p>anxiety = side effect of the sense that something has to be done in the future</p>
<p>lack of anxiety sometimes = lack of forethought</p>
<p>similarly, by stripping pain of its significance and meaning for the future, we also relieve its emotional threat</p>
