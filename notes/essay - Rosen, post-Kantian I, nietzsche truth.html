<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Dr
Rosen, post-Kantian I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nietzsche appears to flit from one subject, style,
interlocutor and mood to another, writing in sometimes darting, swooping or measured
tones. The reader is forced to pursue each of the recurring, interwoven themes
at intervals. This could be a stylistic device to dissuade those who might
misunderstand or misrepresent his thought, to elude academics who would codify
and ossify his call to action or merely a symptom of his peripatetic writings.
Perhaps most of all though, it forces the reader to piece the ideas together,
to <i>ruminate</i> and so immerse oneself in the ideas. But this is difficult.
After a stretch of cogent, scholarly analysis, one finds oneself faced with a
sprinkling of maxims, some wise, some incomprehensible, and some seeming at
odds or alien in relation to other aspects of his thought. And underlying
everything, the references to truth and interpretation seem to be � under<i>mining</i>
everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often, a parallel is drawn between Nietzsche and later
Wittgenstein in their use of unconventional style. In the case of Nietzsche, he
is more like a �courtroom lawyer� than a meticulous analytic philosopher.
Though indeed sometimes he utilises detached, deft cuts of precision and
insight, he sinks to <i>ad hominem</i> attacks and flights of figurative,
metaphorical and often incomprehensible purple prose, dashing wild sweeps of
rhetoric, where the force and power of the writing replaces careful, evidenced
argument. Wittgenstein�s later writings (e.g. <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>)
depart markedly from his earlier considered painstaking procedure (e.g. <i>Tractatus</i>)
for a reason � Wittgenstein preferred to consider in detail a multitude of real
world snippets, building up an alternative picture of things by slowly
undermining the way we usually see them, whose overall effect cannot be
produced by argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why then, does Nietzsche write as he does? He eschews the
usual form of reasoned, step-by-step argument because he did not seek the
readership of the �philosophical labourers� � in fact, the vicious personal
attacks may have been included to discourage such readers. Rather, his purpose
is to excite as well as to educate. It was to the philosophers of the future
that he wrote, even though he knew none. But as well, his style of writing was
meant to illustrate a new type of philosophising. Rather than analysing the
current state of affairs, determining what intepretations have been and are
being made and what values pertain to what, it is the business of the �new
philosophers�, the �attempters�, to <i>create</i> their own interpretations and
value systems, exploding the systems of today. They are legislators, not merely
analysers. This is why philosophy must be �experimental�, not in the sense of
being empirical, but in terms of continually revising, creating and
experimenting with new interpretations and valuations. Indeed, the task of
these new, true philosophers is the very hardest of all, that of escaping from
the restraints, practises, values and interpretations of their day, for we are
all �children of our time� - stepping outside one�s today is the difficult
business of philosophy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More importantly still than points of style, Nietzsche is
often accused of being self-contradictory. It is easy to find places and themes
where his attitude and arguments resist harmonisation. His discussions of truth
itself provide many such examples: �Truths are illusions, of which one has
forgotten this is so� (<i>TL</i>); �There are many kinds of eyes � and
consequently there are many kinds of �truths�, and consequently there is no
truth� (<i>WP</i> 540); and yet also �At every step one has to wrestle for
truth; one has had to surrender for it almost everything to which the heart, to
which our love, our trust in life, cling otherwise. That requires greatness of
soul: the service of truth is the hardest service� (<i>A</i> 50). We see
dismissal, relativisation and devotion to truth all represented here. Which is
it to be?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Schacht proposes that Nietzsche�s use of the word �truth� is
so confusing is partly because he uses the one word in many senses, both common
and technical. The first sense that springs to my mind when reading his text is
that of metaphysical Truth � this predilection among philosophers to assume
that our world is a world of appearances, a veil for an underlying reality, has
pervaded the work of thinkers from Plato to Kant. This �dogmatism� is rejected
out of hand as an example of philosophers� �evaluative prejudices with respect to
various features of human existence and experience� (Schacht, 1983), including
�appearance, change, pain, death, the corporeal, the senses, fate and bondage,
the aimless� (<i>WP</i> 407). When one ceases to desire truth as consolation
and accepts truth, �even plain, harsh, ugly, repellent, unchristian, immoral�
truth (<i>GM</i> I:1), this world is revealed not as appearance but as is.
Thus, his normative (usually moral) truths are true in the sense that they are
interpretations of our human, all too human condition. These �truths� could
perhaps otherwise be rendered �understanding� or �wisdom�. In the same way that
two proverbs may appear irreconcilable, without detracting from either�s worth
(�Ignorance is bliss�; �The unexamined life is not worth living�), such interpretive
�truths� need to be held together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The apparent incoherence of Nietzsche�s mode of presentation
and writing focuses the reader on the �perspectivism� that such a subjective
view of truth gives rise to. When truth is always interpretation, as viewed through
our physiology, environs and nature, then we can see objectivity in the sense
of a passive, omnidirectional, disembodied eye roving the universe as
impossible. Instead, we can approach it with layers and reflections of
interpretations upon interpretations, each one adding dimension to the last,
and building up a meta-perspective in some way. Perhaps then, an acknowledged,
informed perspectivism can be �truer� and more objective than a single, deep,
entrenched and rich paradigm. For if subjectivity is being tied to a single
perspective, objectivity must surely be a measure of how many distant and
different perspectives you can hold. But this is even further into the future
of philosophy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This way, we can answer Douglas Smith�s objection that by
saying, �There is no truth, is that not too a truth?�, Smith points to the
infinite regression and paradox inherent in a Nietzschean view of truth and
interpretation. Nietzsche�s interpretation of interpretations as violent and
dishonest seems to be turning upon itself. When we see his ambivalence in terms
of different types of truth and ways of searching for it, science and the
ascetic ideal as contrasted with experimental philosophy, Nietzsche never
espouses an absolute Truth but rather substitutes a web of truths and gaps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nietzsche is able to talk of there being no truth, creating
it and also searching for it because he is first contending the notion that
there is a �reality� underlying our world of appearances, demanding that we
must interpret this world we live in in order to live in it. He is not
searching for the absolute, single answer in the way that science or philosophy
usually do � rather, truth is a woman, and must be won, though maybe never
possessed.</p>
