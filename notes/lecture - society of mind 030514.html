<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 14, 2003</p>
<p>ask about cause � it�s raining vs es gibt vs il y a</p>
<p>what�s the difference between a clause and an object???</p>
<p>ask about Turing machine patterns</p>
<p>ask about aliens</p>
<p>jaynes� thesis</p>
<p>no, he didn�t have reservations about having children baptised � he thought it might immunise them :)</p>
<p>angels on the head of a pin � beginnings of nanotechnology :)</p>
<p>Usher � counted up genealogies of Bible</p>
<p>is evolution a sparse (i.e. universal) principle???</p>
<p>C&amp;C commonalities with alien intelligences</p>
<p>same argument from inconceivability</p>
<p>got C&amp;C from figuring out what�s wrong with Chomsky � universal language needn�t rest on LAD � explains the universals in Universal Grammar</p>
<p>NPs, verbs, clauses</p>
<p>that�s what you get if you have a processor with only 2 registers</p>
<p>can�t manage many pronouns at once</p>
<p>did he publish this anywhere???</p>
<p>can�t refer to 2 levels above in the parse tree and two to the left</p>
<p>Minsky: don�t make tristinctions � might think very differently if you had many registers</p>
<p>maybe having more STM slots makes it harder to learn � or it might just be expensive</p>
<p>what if language wasn�t serial???</p>
<p>see Duplication in SoM</p>
<p>how do you make a copy of a SemNet or a frame???</p>
<p>kind of like the problem of copying data structures which contain pointers???</p>
<p>uniframing + different arch roofs� - copying � needs to be done serially� - huh???</p>
<p>had to have serial processes before language if you were going to make copies of things, because I couldn�t imagine how a NN could make a copy � now he can, just by imagining a press that clunks down and leaves an imprint on a blank vector</p>
<p>prof - grew a new register</p>
<p>Albert Myer � very creative complexity theorist � first class went badly � forgotten what�s hard</p>
<p>problem of other minds � then how does it know to lie</p>
<p>if consciousness is epiphenomenal then the brain-structure will determine its function, even down to talking like a conscious person</p>
<p>argument against zombie argument � you can�t actually imagine a zombie, because you can�t explain how the brain works, so you can�t imagine it</p>
<p>not seen a theory of LTM that discusses how you could make two lists using the same list of Gods in the temple (a la Cicero)</p>
<p>count the size of the list first to make sure you haven�t missed any</p>
<p>one guy remembers as a linked list � Husserl, Phenomenology of Time Consciousness</p>
<p>memorise the alphabet backwards � in case you go too far in the dictionary :)</p>
<p>Boustroffidon � read till the end of the line then read in the opposite direction backwards for the next line � like an ox plough</p>
<p>Papert � learned lots of poems � as you say each line, you think the next line</p>
<p>Barbara: why don�t we have micro-sleeps to memorise important concepts � presumably that�s what you do when you concentrate to try and remember something?</p>
<p>Minsky wants to know whether the people who don�t sleep but have micronaps are for real</p>
<p>Nancy: what happens when we reflect?</p>
<p>all flat � Newell � every set of thinking is a set of productions + reactions to what�s happening on the level below</p>
<p>take a transcript of something you�ve been doing and think about it � if you�re self-reflecting, you need to have a model of yourself</p>
<p>is there anything special about high-level thinking or is it just about lower-level thinking?</p>
<p>Nancy: if you lack language, can you reflect?</p>
<p>feral children don�t appear to be able to solve hard problems</p>
<p>but they may have been put in the closets in the first place because their parents couldn�t stand them because they were retarded�</p>
<p>Nancy: apparently, Asperger�s syndrome kids take longer to start speaking, but jump to full sentences much faster</p>
<p>McCauley didn�t speak until he was 5 � first words were �what ails wee baby Jamie?�</p>
<p>Geschwind � demonstrating a catatonic patient � he�s normal but he can�t talk � �I can so� � �why haven�t you spoken?� � �I didn�t think I had anything important to say�</p>
<p>Jaynes � first psychology fiction � his mind threw up</p>
<p>why wasn�t there psychology between Aristotle and just before Piaget? his theory: that they didn�t realise that the mind wasn�t unitary, and it�ll take ages after that to figure out a mechanics for such a many-part system</p>
<p>maybe the reason that Confucius seems profound is that things got invented and forgotten before writing � is that when writing happened???</p>
<p>how expressive is Egyptian???</p>
<p>some types of science is cultural � e.g. Germans considered theoretical physics to be Jewish science because it had no applications � so all the Jews went to America and invented the atom bomb</p>
<p>Sherry Turke�s first book on the psychology of nerds</p>
<p>trichotomies are very rare � 2-party system</p>
<p>trichotomies are kind of 1.5D � well assuming you�re already trying to divide each dimension in half�</p>
<p>it takes children a year to get from two to three apparently - he said there are no natural triples around you</p>
<p>trichotomy � Peirce � three forms of conclusion � deduction, induction and abduction (what does that mean??? � do you have a case and a rule and an application of a rule as the three parts of them)</p>
<p>abduction � constructing a hypothesis � how�s that different from </p>
<p>syllogism � invert the socrates mortal triptych</p>
<p>Minsky: abduction is anything that isn�t the other two</p>
<p>make a hexagon out of 3 diamonds</p>
<p>things you find around you that have 3</p>
<p>stools, fork tines</p>
<p>Push: movies :)</p>
<p>beginning, middle + end</p>
<p>Hegel dialectic</p>
<p>Trinity</p>
<p>don�t do comparisons between three things � combine the two opposites � made of trans-frames � maybe smart people have triple-frames � or maybe an AI could get past dumbbells</p>
<p>why don�t we learn five before three???</p>
<p>look at Logoworks paper about kids and numbers</p>
<p>what�s missing from the Emotion Machine? what have we acquired since the chimps that makes us so much smarter?</p>
<p>Minsky in the past: an extra level, or an extra register</p>
<p>Bob: use words to refer to things inside your head</p>
<p>me: recursive feedforward models � i.e. you can plug a model (e.g. of a person) into a model (e.g. of the world)</p>
<p>syntax � apparently 2-year old children have the grammar for temporal order, but assume that you mean what�s most likely/common sense rather than what the grammar says</p>
<p>so apparently they understand the difference between �go out after I open the door� and �go out before I open the door� � but don�t behave differently till 4 � don�t understand this???</p>
<p>meta-Turing test</p>
<p>if a creature devises a test for intelligence for objects of its own creation, then its intelligent � so humans are intelligent because they created the Turing test</p>
<p>Fredkin was very impressed with squirrels � followed one round for a day � fell out of a tree numerous times :)</p>
<p>a mouse can apparently fall from practically any height � reaches a terminal velocity of c. 15 miles/hour</p>
<p>Hillis � threw the mice out of the window � out of pity, he put them in paper bags to make sure that the terminal velocity was slower � but a cat learnt to wait for the paper bags and tear them open before the mouse could get away</p>
<p>I want to write a program that sees analogies between chess boards � need to form new concepts, e.g. the sphere of influence of a piece, the value of each piece, pieces that are guarded by other pieces, areas of the board under attack, that the king is in check</p>
<p>maybe the key would be to find a compressed representation for the actual coordinates � using the Feldman grid compression???</p>
<p>RAAM</p>
<p>maybe you have a billion neurons that just look for correlations in 3 or 4 inputs</p>
<p>you�re not going to have 10,000 ideas</p>
<p>so if you�ve got a 100b neuron budget, you might as well spend a lot on low-grade search to save you having to come up with all the ideas</p>
<p>learning the moves</p>
<p>Bob: reduce the system to the minimum system of complication � hexacon � 3x3 grid with just pawns � start with a trivial game and gradually make it more complicated</p>
<p>if you didn�t have the idea of diagonals, you�d never understand bishops</p>
<p>they�re all relative</p>
<p>the first Newell chess board was on a 6x6 board</p>
<p>learning the black and white colours is important � then you can learn that knights always end up on a different colour</p>
<p>checkers only has 32 squares � 64/2</p>
<p>horses jump</p>
<p>kings are important</p>
<p>Turing machine search</p>
<p>same problem with trying to find the conceptual primitives of space + time</p>
<p>interior grounding � one line, 3 or 5 points � higher levels move a piece around at a time � represents time and space � the frontal lobe</p>
<p>start with everything made of lines � one line � </p>
<p>that represents space or time � automatic terrific metaphor</p>
<p>thinks that people can do 2d but 3</p>
<p>refce: Drescher � example in <em>Made up minds</em></p>
<p>unhelpful response</p>
<p>Metagame by Barney Pell, also John Orwand at MIT</p>
<p>trying to come up with a general AI to play any symmetrical chess-like program � the rules are described to the AI and it tries to play it well</p>
<p>central parameters � rarity, motility and the rank</p>
<p>treated tic tac toe as a board game � 3x3 game board, and have X and O pieces starting just off the board � each piece is only allowed 1 move of up to 3 places � used the same </p>
<p>all the chess people agree on: advancement, centre control (not in Go), mobility and king safety (not in checkers)</p>
<p>time is a dumbbell</p>
<p>I reckon if you�ve got memory, you�ve got future/hypotheticals for free � you couldn�t have past without future</p>
<p>Nancy: are there emotions without opposite?</p>
<p>we don�t use 3, but prefer 2 or 4, because you need one bits to represent a distinction, and 2 bits to represent 3 or 4, so you might as well go for 4, because you get the extra for free</p>
<p>Shannon: considered using ternary unit of information � said that e is a better choice than base-2 � because he�s using logs???</p>
<p>Google doesn�t cache pdfs</p>
<p>Fredkin: why don�t we just ask some billionaire to buy all the books, then we wouldn�t have to worry about copyright</p>
<p>in EM, he�s mostly quoting his friends or making them up :)</p>
<p>it�s weird that Scientology doesn�t pay tax but gets copyright on its work � Keith Henson is a political refugee in Canada because Scientology got a judge to convict him for putting their text online (usually the copyright sells for $3-400k)</p>
