<h1 id="lecture-society-of-mind">Lecture � Society of mind</h1>
<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>February 5, 2003</p>
<p>shame - when you're worried that what you're doing will be disapproved of by someone like your parent that you want to think well of you - cf Aristotle, Rhetoric</p>
<p>books on how to feel better, whether you deserve to, or not J</p>
<p>Aristotle - brain theory, cooling the blood - surface to volume ratio...</p>
<p>problems with translating mind, agent etc.</p>
<p>how did writing the SoM in fragments help with the lack of a 'plot'???</p>
<p>why doesn't he mention 'consciousness' in the SoM???</p>
<p>����� you mention that we have to put a bracket around which processes to call 'mind' - do you have any new ideas about how to group those???</p>
<p>vectors - invented by Gibbs - when???</p>
<p>augustine 400s - how does the mind work? and how come it's so hard to do the right thing?</p>
<p>����� a person is just the memories you have...???</p>
<p>����� minsky sees his discussion of trying to remember something by associating components of the idea as a precursor to the idea of data structures</p>
<p>analogy between the chinese room and viavoice... J</p>
<p>he characterises the chinese room in terms of a processor and a set of rules, i.e. a von neumann machine - does it help that brains don't differentiate between processing and rules??? almost certainly not relevant, since that's only at the level of implementation</p>
<p>����� could you argue anyway that the neural network has the processing in the activations, and the memory in the weights ...???</p>
<p>no, because the activation can be the memory, and the weights the algorithm�</p>
<p>he argues that the main problem with the Chinese Room is that it assumes its own conclusion, by assuming that because he has the word 'understanding' there must be something that brains have that the chinese room doesn't</p>
<p>on the one hand, augustine is looking to find out about the soul, while also talking about the mind as a cavern containing subcaverns in incomprehensibly complicated ways</p>
<p>early psychologists: wundt, james, helmholtz, galton</p>
<p>Lavoisier's insight about oxygen came in a flash when he realised that the smell of sulphur could be particles floating in the air, and that these particles might not even be sulphur</p>
<p>psychology was held back by physics envy</p>
<p>cf skinner, even trying to write his last book on how his few laws could explain learning language</p>
<p>IMHO: a much better model for how the mind works is the manifest rules of syntax, rather than physics</p>
<p>minsky points out that while piaget is applauded for his discoveries, made mainly by interviewing his three children, freud is widely criticised by his intensive interviews over years with just a small number of patients :)</p>
<p>����� argues that whenever there's some paper arguing that infants can count or whatever earlier than piaget realised, then they've just discovered some other mechanism besides the one that the seven year old is employing</p>
<p>doesn't searle sort of think that something global emerges as a single consciousness out of the brain???</p>
<p>idea of difference-engines comes from allen + newell</p>
<p>there's no way you can understand how thinking works if you assume that there's someone thinking it - this is searle's problem</p>
<p>����� consciousness is just such a single self idea</p>
<p>����� big suitcase of all the different things we don't understand about the mind</p>
<p>attention is negative - it's about keeping everything else stable</p>
<p>����� parallel beings would realise that consciousness is not a positive thing, but a suppression</p>
<p>he says that neuroscientists just don't think about the high-level - they don't know what cache is (hippocampus)</p>
<p>����� grossberg is the only neuroscientist with a decent theory of cortical columns - minsky thinks they might be the terminals for frames</p>
<p>the 'emotion' machine - because we want to explain thinking in terms of ways of thinking</p>
<p>����� as opposed to emotions as something extra that's added to the brain, like colour</p>
<p>����� e.g. makes you reprioritise, assign lower importance to long-term goals etc. if you're angry, or infatuated - emotions as subtractive, rather than additive</p>
<p>hypothalamus - hot/cold</p>
<p>if consciousness is subtractive, doesn't that leave you with panpsychism???</p>
<p>I think he means attention, rather than consciousness</p>
<p>why is the brain connectionist, if the algorithms it's implementing are so much higher level???</p>
<p>he thinks that the brain uses neurons cos they're digital</p>
<p>he thinks that the brain could be implemented on a pentium one</p>
<p>it's only the way it is because evolution has to stick with what came before it</p>
<p>����� (might not include visual processing)</p>
<p>you may need many hundreds of neurons for one bit of reliable memory</p>
<p>you don't want emergence, i.e. a big complicated system that emerges into something clean and simple - it's one of the worst ideas in our culture - i don't understand it so noone else can - they've just given up and stopped thinking</p>
<p>����� there aren't any examples in science of phenomena that get described as emergent and stay like that for ages</p>
<p>����� understanding is to know how each part works and how it relates to all the others - reduction ignores these relations</p>
<p>����� he thinks that all of kaufman's good examples are of things where we can actually see how it happens</p>
<p>global workspace theory of consciousness (baars) - agents can't crosstalk</p>
<p>����� since the agents all have different internal languages, you'd be much better off with lots of different blackboards, rather than one with a high signal to noise ratio and loads of filter</p>
<p>why are people afraid to work on common sense? this is the reason that his ideas haven't been built as systems</p>
<p>����� there's something in our culture that evades such approaches</p>
<p>e.g. what do you do about pollution - reduce the population...</p>
<p>����� lots of things would be better</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>paranome???</p>
<p>i know that we're talking about separate levels, of implementation and of algorithms or function, but wouldn't you expect there to be more neuroscientific evidence to support some of the high-level AI theories that you have put forward???</p>
<p>how many of the main theories of humour has Minsky embraced???</p>
<p>�� humour as surprise - yes, in that you're sneaking up on your censors by employing a second frame that it doesn't notice, right???</p>
<p>�� superiority - yes, because you're often using it as a mechanism for learning (often through social or self-rebuke)</p>
<p>�� relief - no, not really???</p>
<p>�� incongruity - is this the same as surprise???</p>
<p>do we have a separate logic reasoning agent, or is it simply a version of uniframing etc. that happens to work with more abstract, algebraic symbols???</p>
<p>do we have a uniframing agent, or is it a method that all agents employ???</p>
<p>does it make sense to talk of different types of agents??? are k-lines, scripts, isonomes etc. all types of agents???</p>
<p>do you really think that entire, or even large portions of, old agents remain in our brain dormant to this day???</p>
<p>will it ever be possible to tease apart the distributed connectionist representation of the brain to see different agents and realms???</p>
<p>why does he think we have emotions??? how did they relate to learning??? did he link them to intellect in the same way as damasio???</p>
<p>how do you explain the so-called 'g-factor' noticed in almost all IQ tests, where children t</p>
