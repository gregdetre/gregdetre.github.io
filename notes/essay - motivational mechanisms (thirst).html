<h1 id="discuss-the-motivational-mechanisms-of-thirst-and-its-influences-on-behaviour">Discuss the motivational mechanisms of thirst and its influences on behaviour</h1>
<p>Much progress in our understanding of animal behaviour has been made since Descartes� postulation of water-powered statues following prescribed patterns of action. We now see behaviour and the conditions of the environment as being linked by the intermediary of the brain, responding to various internal and external receptors. Motivational mechanisms are vital to our survival, because they tune our perceptions and increase the probability of an act (potentiation) in a given situation, e.g. hunger. They are used in self-regulation, self-preservation and sleep. Through them, actions are directed towards objects, goals and expectations.</p>
<p>Claude Bernard first realised that many of the mechanisms involved in responding to changes in the external environment could also be used by the organism in the regulation of the internal environment, comprised of a complex set of bodily fluids which stay remarkably constant despite what is going on outside the animal, e.g. the concentration of various salts, level of dissolved O2, nutrients (e.g. glucose), acidity and temperature. In this way, the motivational mechanisms in animals drive feedback and control systems, similar to those found in central heaters in homes.</p>
<p>The body�s water supply is crucial to every aspect of normal functioning. We continually lose water, through urination, respiration, sweating, defecation and occasionally vomiting and bleeding. This water loss has to be monitored, with action taken when it drops below a certain level.</p>
<p>Blass and Hall�s study on rats with tubes implanted, which drained water out of their stomach as fast as they could drink it, showed that a dry mouth is just one indicator of thrist. In fact, there are two separate aspects of our internal water balance: the water volume existing inside our cells, and the volume of the fluids that circulate outside our cells (e.g. saliva, blood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid etc.). Both intracellular and extracellular aspects of our water balance are controlled by separate receptors, making their own set of internal homeostatic adjustments.</p>
<p>Extracellular receptors are located throughout the body, especially the heart and surrounding blood vessels, which detect the drops in blood pressure that occur whenever there is a drop in the total amount of bodily fluid. Signals from these pressure receptors can lead to a various attempts to restore normal blood pressure, such as through the use of a hormone called vasopressin (or anti-diuretic hormone), manufactured by the hypothalamus and secreted by the piuitary gland into the bloodstream. This hormone causes the blood vessels to constrict, driving up blood pressure as well as making the kidneys retain rather than excrete water.</p>
<p>Studies on dogs with a small baloon inserted into the large vein leading to the heart showed that, when inflated, the dogs drank copiously. The balloon impeded the blood flow into the heart, causing a decrease in fluid pressure, causing the pressure receptors to signal the brain to initiate drinking (Fitzsimons and Moore-Gillow, Rolls and Rolls 1982).</p>
<p>The amount of another hormone, angiotensin II, floating in the bloodstream, is modulated by receptors in the kidneys, which also detect the volume of extracellular fluids. This hormone seems to act on receptors just in front of the hypothalamas amongst other areas (Epstein, Fitzsimons and Rolls, 1970), again an extremely powerful and immediate motivator of drinking if injected into the bloodstream or directly into the brain.</p>
<p>The osmoreceptors depend on the chemical process of osmosis, where a sem-permeable membrane allows the free flow of water but impedes the flow of substances dissolved in it, leading to a flow of water from the less concentrated region into the more concentrated region.</p>
<p>Studies where tiny drops of solt water injected into regions in or around the hypothalamas of a rat led immediately to drinking, showing the role of the osmoreceptors. When the concentration of sodium ions in the fluid surrounding the receptor was increased, water leaked out by osmosis to equalise ion concentrations in the two areas, causing the cell to deflate somewhat, causing the receptor to fire (Rolls and Rolls, 1982).</p>
<p>The need for so many different receptor systems monitoring the levels of bodily fluids stems from an evolved advantage in having multiple defenses, with backups if one system were to fail. As with any internally regulating system, there is only a certain amount of adjustment that the body is able to achieve to restore the bodily balance, after which the corrective measures must involve some externally directed behaviour, obviously drinking in the case of thirst. Yet the levels of redundancy in thirst regulation are even less than that of maintaining the body�s nutrient levels by feeding.</p>
<p>Simple drives such as eating, sleeping and drinking can explain some of the most basic elements of animal behaviour, but composite models which take into account threats and being faced with novel situations are necessary to understand behaviour at a higher level. The drive-reduction theory posits that all built-in motives act to reduce stimulation and arousal, so that all organisms strive for an optimum level of arousal, below which they try to incresae arousal by various means. Drugs provide one such way of modulating the arousal level, with some drugs acting as depressants (e.g. alcohol and the opiates) and others (such as amphetamines and cocaine) acting as stimulants. Repeated drug use leads to addiction, increased tolerance and withdrawal if the drug is withheld.</p>
<p>The opponent process theory of motivation explains drug tolerance and withdrawal, amongst other things, with the argument that all shifts of arousal level product a counteracting process which moderates the modulation, i.e. flattens the peaks and troughs. When the original instigator of the shift is removed, the opponent process is revelaed more clearly, as in withdrawal.</p>
<p>Speculation about possible �pleasure centres� in the brain, which when stimulated leads to specific rewards as reinforcement for the behaviour. The dopamine hypothesis of reward, the it is the activation of fibres originating the nucleus accumbens triggered by dopamine which provides neural stimulation for repetition of the action.</p>
<p>Thirst is an example of a vital bodily need, which can be moderated to a small extent by internal adjustments such as instructing the kidneys to retain rather than excrete water. However, beyond a certain point, there can only be one remedy, that of consuming more water to address the need.</p>
