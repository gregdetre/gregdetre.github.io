<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Mr
Snowdon, Philosophy of Mind III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers are
meaningless as a result of our failure to understand the logic of our
language�. Wittgenstein�s scattered remarks, concrete examples and inconclusive
interlocutions are carefully deliberate. He is trying to force a change of
attitude, rather than present a set of views to be distilled and adopted. His
apparent unsystematicity of presentation is not because he is unable to write
in a conventional format, but because his thought is characterised by, and best
represented by, this style, this care in expressing thought with language
without being led by or altered by language-in-use. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>�Philosophy, as we use the word, is a fight against the fascination
which forms of expression exerts on us.�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His system of �grammatical investigation� is intended to
analyse, by demonstration, our particular way of expressing and using language
with regard to a given area or concept. He gives concrete examples, discusses
what we will accept as verification, how we would explain it to a child, where
the areas of contention are � and in this way, the reader is forced to actively
assemble his own understanding of how we talk about that area. There is no
conclusion drawing it all together, only this wheeling around the topic,
picking it up and examining it, by discussing it, coming to understand it and
so see and avoid, the pitfalls surrounding it. This seems somewhat like the
�intuition pump� that Dennett talks about and criticises as a means of
illustrating a point in philosophy. For instance, when Searle came up with the
Chinese room argument to attack the idea that symbolic rules could give rise to
consciousness, you hear the thought experiment, and you immediately grasp his
point � �though a list of rules might <i>seem</i> conscious, it would be an
illusion� � Wittgenstein uses a similarly illustrative style, almost as a means
of illustrating its limitations. He has no choice, because the means of
communication here <i>is</i> the topic of discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wittgenstein�s intention is to expose how our use of
language affects our thought processes. He talks about �grammatical
differences�, where we use words differently when talking about an area or
concept, so that the words take on different properties and relations to each
other, i.e. altering their patterns of usage. By studying them in the wild as
it were, by examining language-in-use, watching how we talk about examples and
discuss the problems around them, we build up an appreciation of what we mean
by the words. Indeed, he goes so far as to recommend that this should be
philosophy�s approach to all discussion. To some, this feels almost as though
he is recommending that we give up our attempts to penetrate and explain
phenomena, instead merely <i>describing</i> them. McGinn styles this opposing
attitude, the �theoretical attitude�. This �theorising� underlies the method of
science. But Wittgenstein believes that it will not help us when discussing
thought and meaning. In fact, looking for �discoveries� when trying to
understand thought and meaning by analogy to questions like �What is the
specific gravity of gold?� is what has led philosophers to metaphysics, i.e.
�complete darkness�. Thus, we will find that �everything lies open to view
[and] there is nothing to be explained�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problems that are thrown up by our use of language to
reflect on language are deep, and the �theorising� path is enticing and
passakble, hence well-trodden. When we attempt to explain meaning or sensation,
we reify them; from being an �object of comparison�, a way of looking at
things, we transform them with a literalness and explanatory force we don�t
give them in ordinary life into �a preconceived idea to which reality must
correspond�. He attacks the idea that our explanations, or �pictures� help us
grasp the phenomena in two ways: firstly, by showing that these accounts and
models do not tie in or resemble how we actually use language in describing
these phenomena; and secondly, by showing that we don�t need explanations - all
we need is to rearrange what we have always known, and the problem will cease
to be, we will see how things are and we will be satisfied without having had
to seek an explanation. For we are investigating the nature, or essence, of
phenomena, and everything we need to know is contained in the structure of
language-in-use, discernible by comparing how different regions of language
differ, i.e. teasing out the �grammatical differences� � this is a �grammatical
investigation�. Thus, when we can see the connections, see the pattern that
emerges from our grammatical investigation, we have formed a �perspicuous
representation�, i.e. a clear view of things, and so we understand them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wittgenstein�s consideration of a �private language� goes
back to William James� idea (in the Principles of Pyschology) that we might
form an ideal psychological language by which to refer to our subjective
experiences, without reference to the objective world at all. This would allow
us to better undertake the business of psychology, �discovering states of
consciousness� by means of introspection. James argues that we need such a
language, since even when we discuss the contents of our introspections and
immediate sensations we are only able to describe them in terms of their outer
world causes and instantiations, e.g. �a cheesy taste�, �a thunderous sound�,
�an orange colour� etc. For him, we need to be able to describe our
introspection, since this is how we access psychological phenomena, since �for
an organism to have conscious experience at all � there must be something it is
like to <i>be</i> that organism� (Nagel, 1979).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tempting though it may be to try and learn about the nature
of (our) psychological phenomena by introspection (turning our attention
inwards), Wittgenstein deems this fruitless: one cannot learn about the nature
of sensation by paying close attention to the feeling of a headache. On the
contrary, we should not be concentrating our attention on the subjective
feeling of actually being in pain, but rather look at the �kind of statement we
make about the phenomena�. Just as James considers an ideal psychological language
with which we could pin down and learn from our introspections, Wittgenstein
plays around with the way we talk about sensation in order to show that
introspection can never lead to a definition of a psychological term. Thus, his
�private language argument� takes his usual form of considering in detail many
concrete examples of our discussions and descriptions, so that our
language-in-use becomes the object of study. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He looks at the way we teach and children learn language
about pain. We teach them to replace their wailing and exclamations with words
and sentences � new pain-behaviour. Using the word �pain� and talking in
sentences about it replaces the grammatical concept of crying. There is no
reference to internal states or subjective feelings of being in pain needed or
involved in defining this new linguistic pain-behaviour. Neither the adult nor
the child points inwardly to the headache and anchors or ascribes to it the
notion of �pain�. The connection between �pain� and the feeling is established
by looking at the grammar of the psychological concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wittgenstein attacks the idea that pain is private in the
way that a picture in my head is private. One does not �know� that one is in
pain � you just <i>are</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> in pain.
Thus it is possible for someone else to know I am in pain, but I just am in
pain. He is demonstrating that the public/private distinction is a grammatical
one. The grammar of sensation and behaviour concepts enables us to
differentiate their essences. �Essence is expressed by grammar�. </span>Thus, to
say �Sensations are private� is effectively tautologous. The psychological
language-game differs from the physical language-game in its logic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problems we have in talking about pain are related to
this public/private distinction we think there is. Can we talk about �pain� in
the same way that we talk about �chairs� � �this one is qualitatively similar,
but they are still numerically distinct�? We don�t have a means of identifying
pains � looking inward and introspectively pointing to the pain doesn�t help.
We cannot fix the boundary between the psychological and the physical in terms
of what we can introspectively know and what is publicly visible/accessible
then � we need to look to grammar to set the boundary and tell what kind of
thing �pain� is � no other criterion or point of reference, e.g.
introspectability, will help. So, Wittgenstein�s intention here has been to set
up an opposition between introspection and grammar as the source of our grasp
of what pain is. Now, with the private language argument, he�s going to attack
introspection as a means of understanding what sensations in general are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wittgenstein starts by asking why I can�t just associate a
name in my head with a given sensation that I feel. The interlocutor asks what
would happen if adults displayed no pain-behaviour (did not groan, grimace
etc.). The interlocutor answers that it would be impossible to teach a child
the use of the word �toothache�. But the child would still be able to associate
the actual sensation of a toothache with a word of its own in its head. Or
would it? Apparently, our ordinary technique of talking about pain is bound up
with our natural expression of pain, i.e. the word �pain� and how we use it in
sentences (i.e. �pain� as a grammatical concept) grows up directly out of
�Ouch� and a grimace. �Pain� as a grammatical concept refers to pain-behaviour,
but not the feeling of pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So why can�t the child just call this sensation �pain� or
whatever, by associating the sensation with a name? Because this naming that we
are able to do so easily in normal language rests on a lot of preliminary
stage-setting. We cannot simply name something; this presupposes a whole
grammatical structure into which our new word can simply slot. Without a
grammar for psychological language, we have no means of defining our new word�s
meaning, since we cannot place it in context relative to other words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, we can�t name our sensations because: naming
pre-supposes a grammar; and introspection doesn�t supply this grammar. He talks
about marking a calendar on every occurrence of the sensation, in order to make
explicit the connection between the sensation and its symbol/name, �S�. But
without a criterion of correctness, how can we be sure that we know the bounds
of the sensation, i.e. can exactly when we are and are not experiencing that
sensation denoted by �S�. So the problem becomes: we are unable to parcel up
our phenomenal landscape and so we are unable to define grammatical concepts
and their connections to each other (i.e. <i>name</i> them). If we can�t talk
of our use of �S� being �right� or not, we have failed to give �S� <i>meaning</i>.
We�ll never know if we�re using �S� correctly because we�ll never be quite sure
what �S� was referring to, and we�ll never have the original sensation to which
we were referring to compare against our current use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk of a grammar of introspection as being
necessary to name the contents of our introspection, we talk of a means of
knowing what it is that we have named. He is not baldly saying that language
cannot connect with the inner, only that it cannot connect through
introspection. �Introspection can never lead to a definition�. There is a
difference between a lack of grammar (to establish what it is exactly, i.e.
which bounded area, of my total awareness that I am singling out with this
name) and our inability to remember in future what I had meant by the name.
Wittgenstein is more worried about the first part, that �S� doesn�t have a
meaning because it doesn�t have a use because there�s nothing that determines
and no way of knowing when to write it in the diary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, the private linguist has no non-circular usable
criterion of correctness to apply against future uses of the name, �S�, and his
memory of the original sensation is fallible. He needs public criteria against
which to hold up his use of �S�. Without such an independent check (e.g.
behavioural manifestation) a private language�s hold on our psychological
concepts is tenuous and shifting. In short, in order for there to be language
about sensation, it must refer to the public exhibition of sensation, rather
than the direct, private introspection, because we have no other way of fixing
what we mean by sensation-names.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Critics have labelled this as just a verificationist defence
of logical behaviourism. It can be seen as akin to Galen Strawson�s broad
definition of neobehaviourism as requiring all mental states to have
behavioural implications. Wittgenstein is not suggesting in an ontological
sense that mental states must have behavioural implications, but that if we are
to know about them, then it is true (i.e. in an epistemological sense). McGinn
wants to focus on the message that we cannot understand psychological concepts
through introspection. So it�s not so much that psychological concepts <i>must</i>
have behavioural implications, but that it is through a grammatical
investigation of psychological concepts in language-in-use that we can come to
know them best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since Wittgenstein starts talking about �pain� rather than
�S� after <i>PI</i> 263, McGinn thinks he is using his remarks on private
language to bolster a wider argument against our use of �sensation� as
referring to something we point to inwardly, i.e. that introspection is not the
source of our grammatical psychological concepts. It is tempting to think that
the meaning of a sensation word is imparted to us (as from a teacher to a
pupil) from observing others�/our own sensation-behaviour, but that
introspection still plays a vital role in coming to understand what is meant by
�sensation�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Setting up an imaginary dictionary doesn�t help us any more
than pointing inwardly: we still have no concrete point of reference. We cannot
�exhibit� with the imagination in order to point to it, just as looking up a
clock in the imagination determines the time. A person giving himself a private
definition of a word is like the right hand giving the left hand a present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It all comes down to how inwardly pointing to a pain helps
us use the word �pain� in language. According to Wittgenstein, it doesn�t. So
what is it about �S�, if not speculation about what is going on inside the
speaker when he says it, that identifies it as a sensation-word? It�s
grammatical usage: the characteristic first-person/third-person asymmetry, that
ascribing properties of duration and intensity make sense, the possibility of
pretence etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think he introduces the caveat that someone who misuses
�pain� but in an appropriate-seeming way (i.e. consistently, i.e. grammatically
correctly) is like a wheel turning detached from the mechanism. The wheel is the
word, and the mechanism is meaning. This is inconsistent with logical
behaviourism. I think he is saying that correct grammatical usage is enough to
distinguish and identify �pain�, without fixing it independently to
introspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem with Wittgenstein�s account is that it seems to
rid us of the notion that introspection defines our sensation-words without
fully explaining how else we come to be able to use them. However, the private
language argument is strong enough to force us to revise any Cartesian notions
of the mental as being perfectly transparent, and that a language existing only
in our heads is logically possible.</p>
