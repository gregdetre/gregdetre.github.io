<h1>How is the Cogito more effective against scepticism than �I walk; therefore
I exist�?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>Descartes� eagerness to establish the
veracity of the Cogito is understandable. It forms the founding-stone of the
Cartesian system of knowledge, providing his sought-for Archimedean point.
Rejecting or undermining it would have enormous ramifications for any further
conclusions he draws. On the other hand, if it were deemed solid, it could also
provide a starting-point for other first-person epistemological systems, independent
of the conclusions Descartes draws afterwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But many commentators attribute greater importance and
influence to the Cogito in other respects. At the very least, it holds out the
promise of an elegant route leading at least as far as from utter greyness to
sollipsism, even though that path has proved to be fraught with complications.
Others point to an �intellectual shift�, as the last three hundred years have
been dominated by epistemological questions based on a first-person
perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt'>The Cogito evolves through the <i>Discourse</i>,
<i>Meditations</i> and <i>Principles</i>, taking various formulations: notably
�I am thinking, therefore I exist�, and that �the proposition, �I am, I exist��
is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind�.
Both specify its truth within a specific time-frame, i.e. for �so long as I
think that I am something�. Consequently, a continuous present tense (�I am <i>X</i>ing�)
is the most appropriate way to translate the Cogito, and this is what is
assumed to be meant by the title. That the Cogito provides fleeting rather than
timeless certainty has complicated attempts at logical formalisation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt'>Descartes treats the Cogito as a
revelatory beacon of certainty, immune to the wiles of the evil demon.
Initially, it may not be apparent why this should be so. According to him, the
Cogito�s peculiarity lies in being self-evidenced and immediately intuitable.
In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Cogito against scepticism and
determine its uniqueness, we can try altering its emphasis from an act of
cognition to a mundane corporeal act, like walking. After all, �I walk,
therefore I exist� retains the original form of the Cogito. Does it similarly
guarantee the walker�s existence?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes believes the truth of the Cogito to be blindingly
obvious (�Everyone can mentally intuit that he exists�), because it is actually
self-verifying. Unfortunately, two interpretations of the Cogito can be made,
distinguished as being narrow or broad in the scope of their definition of
�thinking�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the narrow interpretation, the Cogito�s certainty
stems from the fact that all reasons for doubting the Cogito entail that it is
true. For after all, doubting is just a special case of thinking, so by
doubting that you are thinking, you are necessarily thinking, and so existing.
Though this may seem straightforward, it does unwittingly assume that mind is
completely and <i>immediately</i> aware of its own activity. Having this
doctrine of the �perfect transparency of mind� forestalls the evil demon from implanting
a thought labelled �Doubting thinking� in our cognitive apparatus. Otherwise,
we would be trapped in the headache of doubting whether we were doubting, even
though as far as we were aware, we seemed to be, and so on. Perhaps the
doctrine can be defended along the lines that, in contrast to extensible
matter, mind is indivisible, so one portion cannot harbour a thought secretly.
However, Descartes also considers that dreams could be sense-perceptions
originating in the mind involuntarily � this seems incongruous with perfect
transparency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Descartes includes a broader variety of cognitive
processes under the umbrella of �thinking�, such as affirming, denying, loving,
hating, willing and having sense-perceptions. If we were granted immediate awareness
of all these different types of thought, an element of intellectual reflection
would be introduced. Thus, as before, it would be impossible to doubt that we
are hoping/willing/loving, since they all involve reflection, as does doubting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this way, because the <i>sensation</i> of walking would
be considered a form of thought, one could postulate �I have the sensation of
walking, therefore I exist�, with the same weight as the Cogito. However, the
actual movement of our body usually implied by this or any other sensation is
still stranded with our corporeal, external-world bodies. In the chronology of
the Meditations, we cannot yet lay claim to these bodies or be sure that they
are as our sense-perceptions depict them, so we can certainly doubt walking without
ourselves or the walker necessarily existing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having established why the Cogito appears self-verifying
while other propositions of identical form are not, it remains to decide
whether Descartes is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>entitled to
describe himself in the first person as a �thinking thing�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is certainly a problem here. Although it may be that
there is thought taking place, should we so quickly ascribe it to a substance
which thinks. After all, the body is clearly delineated, but what delineates or
encloses the thoughts involved in the Cogito as being Descartes�? Again, we
could return to the unjustified notion of �indivisibility of mind�, whose
sanctity thoughts impinge upon, as though from outside. Do we have any greater
control or claim to mental events than we do to the sense perceptions we
ascribe to external objects, or more importantly, our physical bodies? And yet
it is our minds, or more accurately these thoughts, which Descartes claims
immediate awareness of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes� discussion of the wax, and his treatment of
himself as a �thinking thing� demonstrates a view of objects as having a
�substrata� to which their properties belong. It is this underlying substance
which is inferred when the properties of the wax change as it melts, yet our
conception of it remains. By extension, we are thinking things � we think
thoughts. The alternative �bundle� model describes objects purely as a
collection (or bundle) of their properties. Our minds then, <i>are</i> the
thoughts which make them up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to be able to say that <i>I</i> think and <i>I</i>
exist, Descartes has to establish that without a thinker, there can be no
thought. Yet there seems little way that he can move from �thought is taking
place� to say that �I am thinking�. Perhaps it could be argued that certainty
requires agency � �I am certain that I am thinking� cannot be so easily reduced
to �there is certainty that there is thought�. But this is not his argument �
he repeatedly claims immediate awareness of his thoughts, which may be his
mistake. Not only is this highly suspect, but it makes it difficult to see how
thoughts about thoughts can ever arise, one possible hallmark of an agent. Of
course, the question of where thoughts ulimately come from may be unanswerable.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A great deal of controversy surrounds the way in which the
Cogito is posed. Grammatically, it looks like a premise followed by a
conclusion (with another premise concealed). However, Descartes insists that
this is not quite the case. Using the terminology of the earlier <i>Rules</i>,
he draws a distinction between starting propositions which can be immediately
intuited and truth deduced through processes of inference. In explanation,
Descartes could be seen as intuiting �perfect transparency of mind� as a
concealed premise, intuiting that he is thinking, immediately inferring that he
exists (incorporating Williams� suggestion that the missing major premise is
first conceived as being non-existential), and finally inducing the existential
major premise �whatever thinks, exists� from there. Although far more can be
said on this issue, Descartes� confusing descriptions of how the Cogito is both
intuitable and rationalisable afterwards should not be seen as a serious
problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other commentators have attacted the Cogito as being
trivial, saying little more than �I exist, therefore I exist�. In a way this is
true if one accepts the need for some sort of very general non-existential
major premise, but this simply shifts the burden of doubt back one level.
Although it is obvious in one sense that by asserting our existence we must
exist, Descartes tries to frame this in a satisfyingly incontrovertible
fashion. Unfortunately, the pre-suppositions and �linguistic intuitions� which
perhaps need to be made to make any progress from the method of doubt hamstring
the attempt. It does seem that the arguments are strong for thoughts existing
in some form, but Descartes is unconvincing with regard to concrete certainty
in our own existence. However, the Cogito does seem to apply to a wider sense
of �thinking� than might have been expected, including the sensation of
walking, even if not the actual corporeal act.</p>
