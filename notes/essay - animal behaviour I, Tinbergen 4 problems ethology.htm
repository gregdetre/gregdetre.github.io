<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ethology can be most simply described as the science of
animal behaviour. This extremely broad definition immediately raises questions
about where boundaries with related disciplines lie. Tinbergen�s famous 1963
article, �On aims and methods of Ethology�, consolidated and redirected
ethology along four broad lines: causation, survival value, ontogeny and
evolution. His guiding aim was to reform Ethology as �the biological study of
behaviour�, following the general approach of his mentor, Konrad Lorenz, in
seeing a behaviour as an �organ� much like a physiological organ. Since
Tinbergen�s seminal paper, a plethora of revisions to his framework have been
suggested, and the status of the discipline of ethology relative to physiology,
psychology and neurobiology (among others) has altered. Following Tinbergen, I
will discuss the Four Problems as he set them out, and then try to consider alternatives,
criticisms and the wider perspective after.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Firstly though, it may be
important to consider what is meant by �behaviour�, given its central position
in ethology. The most basic starting definition is �Behavior is motion.� When
Tinbergen describes his over-arching discipline of the �Physiology of
Behaviour� as the �study of causation of <i>animal movement</i> with respect to
all levels of integration�<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
he appears to be adopting this stance. Unfortunately, behaviour as motion
ignores many types of behaviour, such as the fright response and sleep. A more
adequate definition is: �What a plant or animal does, in the course of an
individual's lifetime, in response to some event or change in its environment.�
(Silvertown, J. and Gordon, D. M. A framework for plant behavior.<i> Ann. Rev.
Ecol. Syst. </i>20:349-366, 1989). This probably includes everything that we
would want �behaviour� to include, but may be a little bit too general. Rather,
�Behavior is all observable or otherwise measurable muscular and secretory responses
(or lack thereof) and related phenomena in response to changes in an animal's
internal or external environment.&quot; (J.W. Grier and T. Burk, <i>Biology of
Animal Behavior</i>, 1992). This definition outlines what sort of physiological
mechanisms we mean, while remaining satisfyingly broad, and should be suitable
for our purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tinbergen advocates Lorenz�s approach of treating behaviour
as an organ, admissible to the same biological method, and similarly unsuitable
for �subjectivist� accounts (i.e. those which rest on a highly
anthropomorphised view of the animal�s mentality, or apply folk psychological
explanations like �the animal attacks because it feels angry�). He also
advocates caution in how we name complex groups of behaviour, such as
nest-building, fighting or sexual behaviour. Terms such as these relating to
major functional units are often confused as units of mechanism; no
physiologist using the term �eye� to apply to a vertebrate lens and also a
compound Arthropod eye assumes that their mechanisms are the same, but only
that their function, or achievement, is comparable. By treating behaviours as
organs, we stress to ourselves that every animal has a varied and extensive
arsenal of behaviours, just as our body harbours many organs, but that these
remain largely constant and fixed across a species, ceteris paribus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tinbergen raises an important point in his discussion of
causation, about the respective places of ethology and neurophysiology, or
neuroethology as it is now known. At the time he was writing, the techniques
available to neurophysiology limited its investigations to the very basic and
low-level, and were insufficient to analyse the complex behaviours that
ethology addressed. As he foresaw, both disciplines have increased the scope and
power of their analytic techniques in the intervening years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, M. S. Dawkins (1989) points to a very different and
equally worrying issue in modern ethology. Tinbergen�s article directly guided
the activities of a generation of ethologists, now considered �classical
ethology�, where the adaptiveness of a behaviour was under-studied. On the
other hand, modern ethology has emphasised evolution and adaptive function at
the expense of mechanism. Tinbergen showed, with his characteristic attention
to experimental detail and observation, how studies of adaptive function can be
carried out in order to draw legitimate conclusions, but this rested on a firm
body of work carried out on the mechanics (or �causation�) of the behaviour in
action. As Dawkins readily admits, an imbalance in the opposite direction,
favouring mechanism over evolutionary explanations, would prove �dry and
dusty�. She argues vehemently for a redress, since ethology functions most
healthily when it keeps all four of Tinbergen�s problems in perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tinbergen pays repeated tribute to Lorenz�s interest in both
�What is this good for?� and �How does it work? when discussing an organ (with
an �organ� being characterised by its <i>function</i>). Here, Tinbergen draws
an important distinction between experimentation into the survival value (or
adaptive function) of a given organ exhibited in the present, which is open to
scientific enquiry, and experimentation into the particular, contingent
evolutionary history which has led up to the species� current state, which can
only be �traced indirectly�. �Causation� seems a misleading name for the study
of the mechanisms of an organ, given that Tinbergen wants us to view the
causation surrounding the exhibition of a given behaviour in <i>both</i>
directions: its mechanical/physiological cause(s), as well as its effect on
survival value. Both are �observable aspect[s] of a life process�, and are
�concerned with a flow of events which can be observed repeatedly and � thus �
can be subjected to observation and experiment�, unlike the �events of past
evolution�. In theory then, we are studying the causes of survival, but since
in reality it is behaviour that we observe directly, we necessarily see
everything from a behavioural perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problems of assessing survival value stem from the fact
that behaviour is not a piece of matter, like a physiological organ, and
usually we cannot simply excavate it, leaving the surrounding structures
intact. At best, we can systematically compare the success of animals at times when
they do and do not show a given behaviour, but we have to be extremely careful
about the factors that we cannot control that may be influencing this.
Tinbergen suggests the use of �dummies, which we can control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The term �survival value� that Tinbergen used has since been
largely replaced, in recognition of the need to emphasise the
cross-generational consequences, rather than just the survival of individual
organisms. As a result, �adaptive or biological <i>function</i>� are usually
preferred. Pittendrigh�s (1958) use of �teleonomy� (�The property of living
systems of being organized towards the attainment of ends without true
purposiveness� - SOED) may have been apposite, but never caught on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major area of ontogeny (�The origin and development of
the individual organism� - SOED) that ethology was focused on when Tinbergen
was writing was that of learned vs innate behaviour (though he remarks that the
opposite of �innate� is really �environment-induced�). His evocative example of
why a young cliff-dwelling Gannet cannot learn to fly the way we learn to write
highlights why ethology�s early investigations focused on innate behaviour. He
defined �ontogeny� as �change of behaviour machinery during development�, in
order to distinguish it from merely a cyclical or otherwise incidental change
in behaviour. He was also keen that innateness be demonstrated negatively, that
is, by elimination � only when no environmental or cultural influences that
could have shaped the behaviour can be found, can we describe it as �innate�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Evolutionary study has two aims: trying to trace the path
that evolution took, and understanding better how evolution affects behaviour.
In the first case, treating behaviour as organs allows for semi-quantitative
comparisons between different species, to see how much they differ and so when
their evolutionary paths probably diverged. In these studies, correlations with
taxonomists� techniques are apparently good. The second task is closely related
to assessing survival value, and indeed the two areas inform each other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tinbergen�s outline of the ethology�s investigation into
evolution was deficient in one prominent area. Hailman and others have
deliberately chosen or extended this area to explicitly incorporate non-genetic
cross-generational transmission, usually in the form of cultural heritage.
Hailman�s chosen term was �phylogeny�, in its broader, original sense. This
provides a neat complement to �ontogeny�, but is frequently misunderstood due
to his slightly unusual, technical usage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains to clarify the proximate-ultimate distinction.
Dewsbury (1992) discusses the pitfalls inherent in the word �ultimate� (rather
�distal�, which is the more typical complement of �proximate�). �Ultimate�
signifies distance, but also something more fundamental, leading to a confused
hierarchy of levels, which Tinbergen had been explicitly keen to avoid. As
Francis (1990) puts it, �Granted, �distal� lacks some of the connotations of
�ultimate�, but it is meaning well lost�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baker�s (1938) and Lack�s (1954) usage aligned this
proximate-ultimate divide with a how-why divide. In this way, proximate (i.e.
immediate) explanations deal with the mechanics of how an action can be
explained, usually in physiological terms, and ultimate explanations point to
the macroscopic factors influencing the action, usually evolutionary. Mayr
(1961) took this further, linking proximate causes with individuals and organs,
and ultimate causes the evolution of DNA codes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was only much later (Alcock, 1975), that �proximate� came
to stand for causation and ontogeny in Tinbergen�s problems, and �ultimate� for
function and evolution. When seen in this way, the proximate-ultimate
distinction seems to be delineating the study of behaviour within an individual
on the one side, and behaviour that transcends the individual on the other. Of
course, even this analysis muddies things further, since survival value
(Tinbergen�s term) is an issue for individuals, but the intergenerational
adaptive function (Huxley 1942 and Hailman 1976) of a behaviour goes beyond the
individual. This illustration only shows that such strict attempts at
classification inevitably shoe-horn scattered areas of the discipline or split
apart natural groupings. In the same sprit, Hailman�s (1976, 1977) double
partitioning on the basis of individual/population and cause/origin splits
Tinbergen�s four problems rather neatly into:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>This is probably as far as grouping
of Tinbergen�s problems can be taken. Although the �origins� row works well,
Tinbergen had been keen to view �function� or �survival value� as an effect,
though of course he recognised that eventually every effect becomes a cause.
Also, Tinbergen stresses the importance of considering the adaptive function of
ontogenetic development, giving the example of young birds who will try and eat
almost anything, learning whatever happens to be edible in the particular
region they grow up in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The status and pitfalls ethology is subject to have changed
greatly since Tinbergen was writing, especially since Wilson�s (1975)
�Sociobiology�. Tinbergen�s own emphasis on amassing a body of observational
and experimental evidence upon which to firmly ground any discussions of
ultimate is still relevant, especially since the study of evolution outweighs
the other three �legs� of the ethology-animal (to use Dawkins� terminology).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, in more than just the obvious sense, this entire
discussion is academic. Dewsbury�s (1991) �Table 1� serves extremely well to
highlight the fundamental commonalities between the various revisions and
make-overs since Huxley and Tinbergen. These �areas� (Lehner, 1979) or
�problems� come down to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>How do the (physiological)
mechanisms underlying a behaviour work?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>How does the behaviour develop over
the lifespan of the animal?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Why does the animal perform the
behaviour / What adaptive function does it serve?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>How has the behaviour of the species
evolved?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tinbergen built on Huxley�s (1942) earlier tri-partite
�aspects of biological fact�, adding ontogeny to the list, and making the
structure famous and influential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>But
in a way, such explicit formulations of the remit of a discipline are
redundant. The dynamics of scientific disciplines, as they vye to survive the
next funding round, their fitness ostensibly evaluable in terms of papers
published and their complex interactions across a huge geography would make
many University departments interesting organisms for study. Certainly, the ones
still around have proved themselves remarkably successful at evaluating the
direction of their discipline and, where necessary, repositioning themselves.
Currently, the small handful of scientific disciplines have fragmented in every
direction, possibly as a result of the need to specialise just in order to keep
track of the volume of new material being produced. Ethology alone has become
an inter-disciplinary meshing of neuroethology, physiology, psychology,
cognitive ethology, philosophy of mind and artificial life. Though it helps to
have explicit guiding principles and aims, ultimately ethology must follow the
funding, which is ultimately influenced by commercial interest.</p>
