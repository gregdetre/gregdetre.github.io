<h1 id="lecture-society-of-mind">Lecture � Society of mind</h1>
<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 09, 2003</p>
<p>claims that Lisp is powerful (partly) because it�s so easy to define new data structures</p>
<p>rumour that Lenat faked his results � people talked of micro-Lenats as a measure of how much you should doubt someone</p>
<p>AM � found numbers with only three divisors � the squares of primes</p>
<p>he lost the backups and was unable to show people the program running</p>
<p>Ken Hoss wrote a program based on Lenat�s description, which did some of the things that Lenat had claimed � though it didn�t find prime numbers</p>
<p>eventually, it too stopped discovering interesting things</p>
<p>someone suggested that the Critic/Selector model is too brutal </p>
<p>the Crit/Sel model doesn�t take into account the WtT you�re in now, does it???</p>
<p>he found out that when you have longer than 1-page ideas, you have interactions between ideas</p>
<p>�I can resolve all the objections so far by weasel�</p>
<p>see SoM discussion of game</p>
<p>�W. does this by describing �language games�: the practices, activities, actions and reactions in characteristic contexts in which the rule-governed use of a word is integrated.� � method for disentangling conceptual confusions�. � quote from Sarah W notes</p>
<p>simpler example of blindsight � you can see that�s a chair, but you can�t say why you know it�s a chair J</p>
<p>IBM subcontracted the original PC-building</p>
<p>ban international travel, until we know more about genetics and viruses</p>
<p>$100b to build a pipeline to suck the oil out of Iraq</p>
<p>send</p>
<p>hydrogen article</p>
<p>ethics ontology</p>
<p>synopticon</p>
<p>the mutation rate of a virus is proportional to how much of it there is floating around � so ebola isn�t a threat if it�s killing off a village every so often, it won�t mutate and become dangerous � if it gets to a city, it�ll mutate really fast and probably wipe us all out</p>
<p>religions as persistent self-consistent meme institutions</p>
<p>religion would have affected the course of evolution</p>
<p>me: that�s why we�re so credulous J</p>
<p>nancy wants to know what goes in the brain during forgiveness</p>
<p>pah � presumably it�s evolved, or simply it�s because forgiving someone is easier than fighting them � vengeance is only worthwhile as a deterrent</p>
<p>robert wood � n-rays???</p>
<p>if you made a very smart machine, surely the first 1000 would go insane</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>do you see a role for statistical methods at all???</p>
<p>is there a qualitative difference between evolutionary and lifetime learning???</p>
<p>how does it generate new Critics???</p>
<p>do you ever worry about the ethical implications of AI research??? </p>
<p>ethics is just the business of prohibiting important things</p>
<p>what about legal definitions of personhood???</p>
