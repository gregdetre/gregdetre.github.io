<h1 id="lecture-society-of-mind">Lecture � Society of mind</h1>
<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 23, 2003</p>
<p>Nancy: Kosslyn subject who had prosopagnosia and who couldn�t see/represent curves</p>
<p>alphabet/number systems that don�t have curves?</p>
<p>he says that he�s now demoting Critic-Selector model�</p>
<p>why do you need alarms as well as critics???</p>
<p>he says:</p>
<p>alarms go off even though nothing triggered them</p>
<p>the critic has to be reacting to something</p>
<p>I don�t get that distinction</p>
<p>does it make sense to think in terms of alarms (because it�s clear that the brain doesn�t have a main loop like a GUI OS)???</p>
<p>Alan Boyd � fourier analysis of teeth growth rates, showed weekly peaks</p>
<p>Sibelius stopped listening to other composers� music � Herbert Spencer, mental hygiene</p>
<p>how specific are cryptamnesic recreations???</p>
<p>Licklider???</p>
<p>could it be that the reason we�re crap at maths is because it�s all about instantiating variables, which NNs are bad at???</p>
<p>what about language?</p>
<p>pronouns, father/mother etc.</p>
<p>well, maths + number is much more cultural than language, which we have some genetic predisposition for, right (creoles etc.)???</p>
<p>maths is bottom-up � you can�t link it into your common sense or semantic knowledge to predict top-down what a sentence is going to mean???</p>
<p>could it be that you can�t spread the mathematical sentence over your 7 memory slots (because it�s all using the same operations), whereas different subordinate clauses can perhaps be chunked in parallel</p>
<p>someone else: there�s more redundancy and it�s less fragile to mistakes</p>
<p>no non-literary society has invented maths</p>
<p>why do mathematicians prefer short variables, vs programmers???</p>
<p>Minsky likes the idea of meta-education � teaching useful learning skills</p>
<p>e.g. the Cicero method of learning lists</p>
<p>Hofstadter discovered a 9-point circle � what�s that???</p>
<p>refce: Geometers� Sketchpad??? � make a bicycle</p>
<p>refce: Jared Lanier � graphical programming language, apparently???</p>
<p>why separate critics and selectors???</p>
<p>how are new critics generated???</p>
<p>didn�t really answer � says it�s just like creating any other resource</p>
<p>but I�m not really clear how the SoM creates resources full stop</p>
<p>punishment assignment � when you fail � punish the critic that led to the failure</p>
<p>Soar chunked the failures</p>
<p>don�t reward an animal for getting something right � it�s already doing it, and you�ll overstrengthen the connection</p>
<p>same with competitive perceptron learning</p>
<p>in RL nets, isn�t the learning rate much higher when it gets it right???</p>
<h2 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to ask</h2>
<p>why is language serial???</p>
