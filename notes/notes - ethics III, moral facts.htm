<h2>Excerpts � web</h2>

<h3>Routledge � moral relativism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within cognitive relativism, there are those who believe
that there is no single true morality because more than one morality is true,
and those who believe that there is no single true morality because all are
false. J.L. Mackie (1977) represents the latter camp, on the ground that while
morality actually arises out of custom and convention, the meanings of moral
terms presuppose a mistaken reference to <i>sui generis</i> properties that
provide everyone with a reason for acting according to morality (see Value,
ontological status of). Other cognitive relativists see no need to construe
moral terms as containing a reference to nonexistent properties and instead tie
their cognitive content to certain standards and rules.</p>

<h3>J. L. Mackie, from Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong, Chapter One</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie was influenced by the British empiricists, and wrote
books on Hume and Locke. Much of his work can be seen as developing themes
present in those philosopher's works. His view of ethics is reminiscent of that
of Hume. Mackie's final book, published posthumously, was <i>The Miracle of
Theism</i>, in which he argued that all religious belief is irrational. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1.</b> p. 89. Mackie says there are no objective values.
Note that he is not denying (or affirming) that there are any values at all.
I.e., he is leaving it a possibility that there are subjective values. He is
not saying that we should reject morality altogether; he is just denying that
moral values are part of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.</b> p. 90. Mackie distinguishes his view from the one
that says that &quot;This action is right&quot; means &quot;I approve of this
action.&quot; This is not his view, since he thinks that &quot;This action is
right,&quot; insofar as it tries to express an objective truth, is always
false, while &quot;I approve of this action&quot; is clearly going to be true
in some cases. Mackie is not trying to give a reductive account of the meaning
of &quot;This action is right.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7.</b> p.91. Mackie explains that he is not attacking a
straw position: not only have many philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, and
Kant, held that there are objective values, but he also claims that this is a
part of ordinary thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 92. Mackie refers to the debate about the meaning of
moral terms engaged in by Moore. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Noncognitivist&quot; theories say that moral terms
have no descriptive meaning, i.e., they say nothing about the world as distinct
from the agent. Such theories may allow that moral terms express attitudes of
the agent, such as approval or disapproval. In this sense, Hume seems to count
as a noncognitivist. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Naturalist&quot; accounts of moral terms are those
such as Bentham's, which say, for example that &quot;X is good&quot; simply
means that X has some natural property, such as maximizing the general
happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Confusingly, Hume might also count as a naturalist in this
sense, even though noncognitivism and naturalism are incompatible. (The
confusion probably arises from the fact that Hume wasn't really trying to give
an account of the <i>meaning</i> of moral terms, and so fitting his view into
either category is anachronistic and distorting.) Tellingly, Mackie, who is in
sympathy with Hume's view, thinks that there is some truth to both views, but
also some falsity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 93. Mackie says that the problem with these views is that
moral judgements do seem to express claims about the nature of the world (and
so are cognitive) that are meant to have normative implications (&quot;a call
for action&quot;) whatever desires we might have (and so are non-natural).
Mackie points out that for naturalists a moral judgment only have normative
claim on a person if that person has <i>prior</i> desires. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie points out, in support of his analysis of moral
terms, that people are inclined to suppose (falsely) that objective values are
the only kind there could be, so that if there are no objective values, then
there can be no reason to care about anything. (God is dead, everything is
permitted.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>8.</b> p. 94. Having claimed that our moral judgments are
based on a mistaken belief in objective value, Mackie has to justify his claim
that this belief is false. He first gives the argument from relativity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there were objective moral truths, then people would live
according to one moral code. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But people across the world live according to many different
incompatible moral codes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there are no objective moral truths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Addendum: people's moral behavior should be explained by
sociology and anthropology, not in terms of their ethical knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 95. Rebuttal. There are shared elements to all people's
moral behavior, and it is this common core that is part of objective moral
knowledge. These are the basic moral principles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie says that this rebuttal could be only partially
successful at best. It would only justify a small part of conventional morality
(the common core). Many other moral rules would be left unjustified. So Mackie
seems to endorse the argument from relativity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>9.</b> However, he places much more weight on the
argument from queerness. There are two parts to this. First, metaphysical,
based on the idea that we cannot make sense of objective value as being part of
the world. Second, epistemological, based on the idea that even if there is objective
value in the world, we could never have any knowledge of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 96. &quot;Intuitionism&quot; is the view that we have a
special faculty of moral intuition that tells us what is morally right and
wrong. Mackie says that any defender of moral objectivism must assume the truth
of some version of moral intuitionism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie points out that the best defense for the moral
objectivist to the argument from queerness is to say that although it is hard
to say how we know the moral truth or what kind of thing it is, it is no
stranger than many other things that we have no trouble believing in, such as
&quot;essence, number, identity, diversity, solidity, inertia, substance, the
necessary existence and infinite extension of time and space, necessity and
possibility in general, power and causation.&quot; Mackie gives a promissory
note saying that it should be possible to explain all these things in empirical
terms. That is to say, he thinks that we should be able to give a scientific
explanation of all these things, and an explanation of how we know about them.
But he is also ready to bite the bullet and say that if we can't give an
empirical account of one of them, then we should conclude that it is illusory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[It is especially hard to imagine how we might give an
empirical account of logic and mathematics. We have a great deal of confidence
in the truth of these and of our knowledge of those truths, but how are we to
explain that knowledge? Is it truth independent of humans, or would there be no
logical or mathematical truths if there were no human minds?] </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 97. Part of the queerness of objective values is that
they are not meant to be just there in the world, but they are also meant to be
action-directing. They tell us what to do. But our ordinary senses don't
provide us with any information about such entities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are objective values related to natural properties? A
piece of needless cruelty is thought to be objectively wrong. But the wrongness
is neither logically nor causally related to the cruelty. What other kind of
relation is left? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie doesn't go so far as to claim that the idea of
objective values is incoherent. Rather, he says it is much more plausible to
suppose that there are no such things because we can explain everything we see
in the world without resorting to such mysterious entities. The alternative
explanation would presumably be in terms of our subjective responses to the
world. Using Ockham's razor, we should conclude that the simpler explanation is
correct. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>10.</b> p. 98. Mackie still needs to explain why people
make the mistake of believing in objective value. He does this by pointing out
that we have a tendency to project our feelings about the world onto the world,
as if they were part of the world. If a fungus disgusts us, we call it
disgusting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Furthermore, there are social pressures to justify moral
claims. We want to control the behavior of other people, and when they ask
&quot;why shouldn't I do this,&quot; we reply &quot;because it is wrong.&quot;
On Mackie's view, this is just a rationalization, in the sense that we construct
a false justification to make our lives easier. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 100. The &quot;<i>Euthyphro</i> dilemma&quot;: Is X good
because the Gods find it pleasing, or do they find it pleasing because it is
good? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first horn of the dilemma: if X is only good because the
Gods find it pleasing, then why should we agree with the Gods? Is it only the
fear that they will be displeased with us if we don't do what they want? On
this horn of the dilemma, there is no intrinsic goodness to X, and so the fact
that the Gods find it pleasing is just a contingent fact about them. It does
not show why X should be pleasing to us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second horn of the dilemma: The Gods find X because it
is good. This makes the Gods rational and shows why we should agree with them.
But it leaves us with absolutely no explanation of why X is good. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This dilemma highlights the difficulty of providing an
account of the objectivity of value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>12. </b>Summary. </p>

<h3>John McDowell: &quot;Values and Secondary Qualities&quot;</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>I find McDowell's prose
style dense and convoluted. It takes persistence to understand his ideas.
McDowell argues that values are analogous to secondary qualities, enough so for
us to acknowledge their reality, as colors are mind-dependent yet real. In
order to understand this and evaluate the claim, we will need to spend some
time on our knowledge of secondary qualities. This involves metaphysics and the
philosophy of mind. He argument works, at a fundamental level, by reconceiving
how we relate to the world and understand it, and thus what ways in which we
can legitimately talk about reality. His point is that we can legitimately talk
about reality in way which includes values. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1.</b> p. 201. McDowell sets out his own view by
discussing that of Mackie. He says make that ordinary evaluative thought has a
phenomenology of being a sensitivity to aspects of the world. He is thinking
especially of �7: The claim to objectivity of Chapter One of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong</span>.
McDowell thinks it is important to pay attention to the &quot;lived character
of evaluative thought or discourse.&quot; [He is of course making the
questionable assumption that there is some common factor in all such experience
for all people.] The idea is that the world, when we consider it evaluatively,
presents itself to us as morally loaded. It is not, as non-cognitivists would
suggest, that we look at the neutral world and then experience internal
feelings or reactions to the world. Actions and events in the world present
themselves to us as being good or bad in themselves. Mackie thinks that this
experience of the world is an illusion. However, McDowell wants to say that our
moral experience can indeed provide us with moral knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2.</b> If the world presents itself to us as morally
loaded, then we need to give an account of how we get this impression. If the
experience is correct, then it would seem that we have some kind of perception
of the moral. Mackie said that we know that none of the primary qualities of
objects are moral, and he assumed that such moral perception would have to be
of primary qualities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 202. Such a moral sense would be very mysterious, and it
would hard to prove that it gave us knowledge. But why couldn't moral
perception be awareness of secondary qualities. Mackie would say that this is
of no help to the moral cognitivist, because our knowledge of secondary
qualities is illusory as well. There are not really any colors in the world; we
just think there are because our minds make it looks as if the world is
colored. We project color onto the world, but science tells us that colors are
not really intrinsic properties of physical objects. McDowell thinks Mackie is
mistaken about our knowledge of secondary qualities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.</b> Red is a secondary quality. An object is red if it
looks red under certain circumstances. Red objects may not look red under certain
sorts of light, or in the dark. &quot;Red&quot; does not mean having certain
microscopic properties, although it may be that an object is red in virtue of
having such properties. Redness refers to how an object looks to us. Red
objects look as if they genuinely possess the property of being red. When we
look at a tomato, we do not normally think of the experience as if we are
looking at a colorless object that is causing us to have red experiences. We
think of the tomato as red, independently of our experience of it. McDowell
wants to say our normal way of thinking is correct here: a tomato really <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is</span> red, it is not just a matter of <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>looking</span> red. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 203. Mackie thinks that tomatoes are not really red,
although they really are round. He takes from Locke the idea that our
experience of the roundness of the tomato resembles the actual roundness of the
tomato (roundness is a primary quality that can be described by science), but
our experience of the redness does not resemble any actual redness of the
tomato (because science tells us that the tomato really has no color). McDowell
suggests that the idea that our experience of redness could resemble the actual
redness of the tomato is <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>incoherent</span>.
(The argument will be that Mackie is wrong in saying that our experience of
redness <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>fails to resemble</span> the
actual redness of the tomato, because we can't even make sense of what this
would be. It is not like saying that a portrait fails to resemble the actual
person depicted.) To be coherent, it would require </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i) that we could conceive of color as we can conceive of
shape, as making sense independently of how things look. Objects have a certain
shape which is independent of how they look to people. Colors are not like
that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ii) that we could make sense of the idea of a primary quality
of an object resembling our experience of it, e.g., the redness of the tomato
resembling our experience of its redness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell does not think that (ii) is possible. It would
require us to conceive of redness independently of how red things look. We have
no idea how else we might conceive of redness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell agrees that secondary qualities are subjective in
the sense that we cannot understand the concept of them without reference to
our own subjective experience. But he says that they are not subjective in
these sense that they are figments of our experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 204. We cannot think of the relation between our
experience and the world as parallel between that of a picture and what it
depicts. In understanding our experience, we need to focus on its content,
&quot;intentional object&quot;. Then, if an experience is veridical, the
intentional object of the experience does not resemble the thing in the world;
it simply <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>is</span> the thing in the
world. The relation is identity. So if I have an experience of a red tomato,
and the experience is veridical, then the content of my experience is the thing
in the world. This is part of a more general view that we actually manage to
think about things in the world, and not just our ideas of them. If the content
of an experience could only be an idea, then we could never think about
anything except ideas (as Berkeley and later phenomenologists thought we are).
This is another Wittgensteinian theme relating to the private language
argument: our thoughts do not get their content from their intrinsic mental
features. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We could give up the primary/secondary quality distinction,
and say that there is no epistemological difference between colors and shapes.
But then we would have no idea how the scientific nature of objects related to our
experience of the world. The perceived shape of an object would be no related
to its actual shape than the perceived color of an object would be related to
its surface texture. McDowell does not want to give up distinguishing between
primary and secondary qualities, but he cannot distinguish between then on the
basis of the resemblance (or lack of it) between a quality and our idea of that
quality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell wants to keep hold of the view that primary
qualities are distinctive in being both objective and perceptible. In order to
do this, he says we need to give up a view about what it is for a quality to
figure in experience. It cannot be for the experience to have a certain
intrinsic feature. Colors and shapes figure in experience simply as properties
that objects are represented as having, distinctively phenomenal in the one
case, and not so in the other. Then colors and shapes are equally real,
although colors are intrinsically phenomenal qualities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 205. McDowell says that his position does not have to
reject the idea that an experience intrinsic features, but that there are good
reasons to reject the idea anyway. He seems to be saying that the only features
of an experience are its representational features. [This view is hardest to
defend for experiences that do not seem to contain representations of anything,
such as pains, itches, and the colors you see when you press your eyeballs.] </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell summarizes his argument so far. Mackie divided our
understanding of the world into what might be called the &quot;Scientific
Image&quot; and the &quot;Manifest Image.&quot; Mackie thought that in fact
only the Scientific Image is true, and the Manifest Image contains a great deal
of illusion. Objects and events in the world appear to us to be colored, beautiful,
disgusting, bad or praiseworthy. These qualities are part of our Manifest
Image. McDowell argues that this picture of our relation to reality makes it
hard to explain how we have any subjective or phenomenal knowledge of
scientific properties. On McDowell's view, there is an essential subjectivity
to our experience, but at the same time, our experience is not (intrinsically)
misleading or inaccurate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4.</b> p. 206. Mackie defended his view that there is no
good reason to think that objective reality contains colors by arguing that we
can explain all our experience without supposing that colors objectively exist.
This was generalized to skepticism about any objective properties which
resemble our ideas of secondary qualities. McDowell has already argued that it
is not a contingent fact about the world that there are no objective properties
which resemble our ideas of secondary qualities, but that the very idea is
incoherent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves the question for McDowell whether irreducibly
subjective features can be a part of the world. His argument is not that we
need these features to explain our experience, but that someone explaining our
experience cannot consistently deny the existence of irreducible subjectivity.
He concedes that it would be implausible to suggest that values have a causal
influence on the world. Furthermore, there is a crucial disanalogy between
values and secondary qualities. We see something as red if it is disposed to
look red to us. We see something as good if it tends to look virtuous to us.
But there is more to virtue than that: A virtue does not just <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>cause</span> our approval of it: it <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>deserves</span> our approval. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 207. McDowell elaborates this point with the example of
danger. We fear something if it is dangerous. Our fear is not just <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>caused</span> by the dangerous thing, it is <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>justified</span> by it. The explanation of
our color experience is different from our explanation of our fear. We want to <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>make sense </span>of the fear. The best way
of doing this is to say that the object feared is objectively (in the sense of
really, not as an opposite to subjectively) dangerous (or fearful, as McDowell
says). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, we can best explain some of our other beliefs and
behavior by saying that some things really have value. If we try to do without
values in our explanations of our responses to the world, our explanations will
be less intelligible. [Why? Presumably a lot of weight rests on the analogy
with secondary qualities such as color. It is less easy to make sense of our
experience if we suppose the objects in the world have no color. We can talk
about what color an object really is, and of people being more or less able to
tell what color it is. Similarly, it is harder to explain our behavior if we
don't allow that some things are really dangerous, and of some people's ability
to discern danger.] We try to understand ourselves and improve our behavior,
and these two projects are connected. We improve ourselves through better
understanding of ourselves and the world. It makes sense to suppose that some
of our responses to the world are reasonable. Just as we can talk of the real
color of an object, we can talk of the real value of an action, and of the
variation in different people's ability to understand that value. There will of
course be disagreement about values, but that does not invalidate the argument.
In a footnote, McDowell says that the contentiousness of values may be
ineliminable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5.</b> p. 208. McDowell is ready to concede that values
depend on us as much as colors do, but insists that this does not impugn their
reality. But colors, danger, and values all help to explain our experience and
responses to the world. They are mind-dependent but still real. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McDowell considers how his view differs from projectivism,
which says that values are not real, but that we can explain our behavior because
we think that they are real. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>p. 209. He says that projectivism relies on a thin
conception of reality, with no justification for doing so. Furthermore, the
justification of value-responses depends on their functionality. Whether
something is functional depends on a value judgment, and according to the
projectivist, this is a projection of internal approval. The projectivist
mechanism must contemplate itself. This tends towards a systematic theoretical
approach to value. But McDowell thinks that some cases will forever remain
contentious, not capturable in a theory. His approach to value allows for more
of a patchwork of values. </p>
