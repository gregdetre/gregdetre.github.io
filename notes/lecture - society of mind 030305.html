<p>I guess even if he�s right that you could model a brain on a pentium (which I still find highly implausible), you�ve got to speed that up hundreds of times because we�re not prepared to let that simulation run for 10 years</p>
<p>he thinks that there must be a serial controlling process somewhere that sends datasets to the other bits, and tells them to do so many cycles of hill-climbing or whatever�</p>
<p>attacks Fodor for not being a thinker</p>
<p>not thinking hard enough about how it works</p>
<p>considers common sense to be an undecomposable module</p>
<p>both Sloman and Dennett were students of Ryle</p>
<p>Minsky: what good ideas have Nagel and Block had?</p>
<p>talks about MNs as allowing animals to imitate</p>
<p>but actually, can chimps imitate???</p>
<p>he thinks you have to be smarter to imitate than to learn for itself</p>
<p>do autistic children have trouble with expression + face recognition???</p>
<p>why do we forget so much???</p>
<p>re Damasio � but the body is so dumb</p>
<p><em>�emotion as a context of cognition�</em></p>
<p>emotion as a type of thinking, rather than something separate that affects thinking</p>
<p>someone said that there�s a stage of child development where they treat themselves as the third person (at least when they talk) � can that be true???</p>
<p>children appear to divide the world into things that move of their own volition and things that don�t</p>
<p>the sense of a single self is so compelling because we use that self-model as a means of predicting </p>
<p>does Turing actually say that the test tests for intelligence???</p>
<p>he thinks that anyone who thinks the Turing test is valuable is not worth talking to � the Turing test test J !!! pah</p>
<p>if we had a theory of problem types, we could completely do away with the Turing test</p>
<p>the mystery about using associations with familiar items in your bedrooms is that if you do the same thing the next day, you don�t get them confused</p>
<p>remembering numbers � each number is connected with two or three consonants � most strings of 3 or 4 numbers have a good word that you can use to chunk them together</p>
<p>the slots in your STM are probably of different sizes</p>
<p>does the LTM of anterograde amnesics degrade???</p>
<p>if you carry on talking to them for ages, do they remember the details you�ve told them</p>
<p>g-factor � Eysenck showed that speed of identifying longer lines was a better correlate of overall IQ than any single one of the IQ test components</p>
<p>intelligence is based on credit assignment � there might be a single central bit that decides how and what to store � there might be 3 or 5 copies that know/remember a lot</p>
<p>is he arguing that these are blackboards??? I thought that translation between representations was by a series of steps � see micromemes</p>
<p>Braitenberg</p>
<p>hippocampus as cache</p>
<p>common sense helps you with credit assignment because you have expectations about what�s probably relevant that help shortcut</p>
<p>apparently you can learn to wiggle your ears with biofeedback</p>
