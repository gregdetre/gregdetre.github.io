<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is rationality? � Nagel�s objectivist position</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel defines rationality as the capacity �to recognise
objectively valid reasons and arguments�. He is a realist about reason and does
not want to accept reductive interpretations of it is as a �contingent though
basic feature of a particular culture or form of life�. He recognises that he
needs to address the question of how it is that contingent, biological
creatures such as ourselves can have access to such universally valid methods
of objective thought. I want to focus on the extent to which evolutionary
theory supports or undermines such rational objectivism, as I will term Nagel�s
position. </p>

<h3>What is evolutionary theory?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory (or
�neo-Darwinism�) is the principle of natural selection, whereby parental
characteristics that vary across organisms play a role in non-random
differential reproduction. That is, �adaptive� variations are those which
increase an organism�s (or other organisms with similar genes, strictly
speaking) propensity to survive and reproduce (its �fitness�). This process
gradually gives rise to diverse forms leading ultimately, through selective
adaptation to specific niches and environments, to the emergence of new
species. If humans are the end-product of a natural, non-teleological process
of <span class=crossref>evolution</span> that has resulted in the particular,
contingent bodies and brains that we have, then our reasoning abilities and
limitations will be explicable in terms of evolutionary theory too.</p>

<h3>Overview of how evolutionary theory might be related to rationality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curiously, evolutionary theory has been employed by both
objectivists and subjectivists to support their claims. For example, Stich
cites Quine, Dennett and Fodor as implying that evolution selects for
rationality and that irrationality is empirically impossible or unlikely, e.g.:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>creatures inveterately wrong in
their inductions have a pathetic but praiseworthy tendency to die out before
reproducing their kind.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, it seems more plausible that the opposite is the
case, i.e. that evolved creatures (including ourselves) are highly unlikely to
be objectively rational. I will start by reviewing how objectivists try and use
evolutionary theory to directly support their claim, and then try to show that
it actually heavily undermines their case. Accepting that the empirical
psychological and biological evidence clearly undermines the objectivists,
Nagel argues instead that such evidence belongs to the family of arguments that
can be attacked as self-defeating.<span style='color:blue'> Unfortunately, if
we accept his argument, he leaves us in a position analogous to the
�explanatory gap� in philosophy of mind, where the current explanations and
paradigms of hard science are irreconcilable with how things clearly seem to
the objectivists to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Can evolutionary theory be used to support objectivism? (Stich)</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stich considers that there are two main reasons why people
think that evolution insures rationality:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:.5in'>Evolution
     produces organisms with good approximations to optimally well-designed
     characteristics or systems</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:.5in'>An
     optimally well-designed cognitive system is a rational cognitive system</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>He systematically takes apart both of these premises. His
aim is not to demonstrate conclusively that evolution theory is incompatible
with rational objectivism, but merely to show that the rational objectivists
have their work cut out in showing how the two can sit together. I will not
consider the arguments in as much detail, but I will try and recount, evaluate
and supplement them to a limited extent.</p>

<h3>Does evolution produce near-optimal systems?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The notions of �fitness� and �optimality� are central to any
evolutionary theory. A system is �well-designed� if it enhances fitness more
than any alternative. Of course, this is problematic because of the
difficulties of deciding what counts as an alternative. No doubt a predator
which had evolved a high velocity rifle as an extra limb would be at an
enormous evolutionary advantage, but as I will discuss below, the march of
evolution is restricted to a sequence of gradual changes, each adaptive in
their own right � although the end result of a fully-functional rifle would be
highly adaptive, all of the intermediary stages (growing a long, perfectly
straight, protruding barrel, the combustion mechanism, an organ for ammunition
manufacture etc.) would be highly maladaptive right up until they were all
brought together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stich considers a number of technical arguments against a
na� faith in evolution as an infallible optimiser. He points out that natural
selection is not the only process that causes changes of gene frequency in
populations (which is how biologists define evolution). Mutation, migration and
random drift all affect gene frequencies, to a greater or lesser degree. For
instance, a random event or disaster might wipe out a large proportion of a
population, including all the carriers of a particular fit gene, allowing a
less fit gene to take hold in the population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Natural selection does not necessarily choose the best genes
in the gene pool anyway � Stich discusses meiotic drive, the effect of combined
recessive genes, pleiotropy and heterozygote superiority. Each of these
phenomena can lead to less optimal members of the available gene pool being
selected for. In the case of meiotic drive, for example, �certain genes have
the capacity to �cheat� in meiosis [�the process that produces sperm and eggs�]
and end up significantly over-represented in the sperm or eggs�, and so
�obviously, such a gene will spread quickly through a population, even if the
phenotypic effects of the gene are harmful�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to emphasise a deeper problem about evolution
for objectivists that Stich touches on. Evolution is not teleological � it does
not modity towards an end-goal, but by producing various slightly different
incarnations, each one a little bit more or a little bit less adaptive than its
parents. Most modern biologists are gradualists, that is, they believe that a
host of these tiny changes amount to large-scale improvements in the organisms,
like a new organ. In contrast, saltatory explanation holds that sudden, marked
�leaps� (macro-mutations) drive evolution forwards. Assuming the gradualists to
be correct, evolution suffers from what artificial intelligence researchers
term the �hill-climbing problem�. In outline, this considers that the space of
possibilities which evolution is exploring through natural selection working on
population variation can be visualised as a landscape, in which the hills and
mountains represent more optimal designs. If the mechanism of evolution
progresses incrementally, visualisable as travelling in a continuous path uphill,
then a population may become stranded on a nearby hill, unable to traverse to
the nearby mountain (an optimal design) which is separated by a valley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel rightly states that �the essential characteristic of
reasoning is its generality�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>
Nagel is certainly not content to regard his rational capacity as forming
beliefs that are merely relative, true for a New Yorker, true for an American,
true for a human even. He seeks to defend reason as a universal source of
authority. In order to do that, surely our inferential system needs to have
evolved to be absolutely optimal. If it was merely very well-designed, it might
be able to generalise well, but not generalise to �objectively valid�
conclusions. Its conclusions might be much less subjective than a less
well-designed system, but still not entirely generalisable. Given how unlikely
it is that any evolved system is ever wholly optimal, does this mean that we
there is no hope that we could be rational in the way that Nagel envisages? I
think that the answer to this is probably �no�. In the discussion above,
Cherniak showed that there is a scale of rationality, and that Nagel�s
requirements for objective rationality place him at the high end, but not the
top of that scale, requiring a high level, but not maximum, optimality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, it is necessary to show that our cognitive system is
a product of biological evolution. After all, �even if it were the case that
natural selection is a flawless optimiser and that it is the only cause of
biological evolution, it would still not follow that our system of inferential
strategies is optimally well-designed� unless �evolutionary factors are the
only [or major] ones that have shaped our current inferential strategies�. In
order for natural selection to shape a characteristic, there must be variation
in the population that affects reproductive success in a systematic way, and
this variation must be under genetic control either directly or indirectly. He
considers clothing styles and language as examples in which there is great
diversity within the human population, that may have some impact on fitness,
but this diversity is not genetically based. �Had I been born elsewhere, I
would now have the ability to speak Lapp or Korean rather than English.� And
the processes by which languages spread are almost entirely independent of
biological evolution, depending far more on social and historical factors, for
example. Similarly, it may be that �the [inferential] strategies a person
employs, like the language he/she speaks, are determined in large measure by
environmental variables�.</p>

<h3>Is an optimal system necessarily a rational one?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming that the objectivist could show that evolution
produces near-optimal systems, the crucial second step necessary to show that
evolution selects for rational systems is to show that an optimal system is a
rational one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first way of doing this uses the traditional methods of
analytic epistemology. Analytic epistemology is the approach of grounding
cognitive assessment in the analysis or explication of our ordinary evaluative
concepts. It involves showing that �optimality� and �rationality� are
conceptually, analytically identical, that is, �if we analyse what we
ordinarily mean when we say that one inferential system is more rational than
another � we will find we mean that one is more fitness enhancing than the
other�, i.e. �the claim that optimally well-designed cognitive systems are
rational is a conceptual truth�. Stich wants to bring the entire edifice of
analytic epistemology crashing down, so naturally he has little time for this
approach. Moreover, it certainly won�t satisfy Nagel�s demands unless the next
argument, that having true beliefs is adaptive, holds as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>eh???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second means of showing that an optimal system is a
rational one is to argue, in the same vein as the reliabilist accounts of
epistemic justification, that �the rationality of an inferential system is a
function of how well it does at producing true beliefs� (and avoiding
falsehoods). In this case, we need to show that inferential strategies that
generally yield true beliefs are fitness enhancing, i.e. having true beliefs is
more adaptive. Of course, there will always be cases when having a particular
true belief is not fitness-enhancing, e.g. getting the time of your train
wrong, arriving late and missing it, only to find that it crashed en route, in
which case you would have died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>true vs objective beliefs � both
reliabilist???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, subjectivists need to show that a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>generally</i> less reliable system could
exceed a more reliable system. Following Stich, I will utilise Sober�s
distinction between internal and external fitness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The internal fitness of an inferential system relates to how
economically it achieves its effects, in terms of the demands made on the
organism�s memory, processing capacity, energy/resources, time etc. The
declining marginal utility of increasingly accurate beliefs has to be
considered when evaluating an expensive, reliable system as opposed to a less
expensive, less reliable system. A good example of such a trade-off might be
the fact that our cognitive representation of space employs Euclidean geometry,
which isn�t as �true� as Einsteinian relativistic geometry, in that the latter
provides a better quantitative model of the world. It seems reasonable to think
that a relativistic representation of space would require considerably more
processing capacity, in that it would require the agent to take account of the
speed of an object when predicting how heavy it will be to pick up, for
instance. The deviations between a relativistic and a Euclidean system are
quite negligible at the human scale, and would offer almost no selection
advantage whatsoever. Clearly, we would be highly likely to evolve towards any
such cognitively cheaper, equally adaptive though less true system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The external fitness of a system relates to how conducive to
survival and reproductive success it is. One might consider the greater
adaptive value of an over-sensitive strategy which produces plenty of false
positives which have only minor negative implications for fitness but
assiduously avoids potentially fatal false negatives. Such a system might well
yield false beliefs more and true beliefs less, but still be favoured by
natural selection, preferring �reliability-when-it-counts-most� over
�overall-reliability�.</p>

<h2>What sort of less objectivist account of rationality does evolutionary
theory provide? (Stich + Nozick), i.e. what sort of inferential system is it
likely that evolution has left us with?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nozick�s account supplements Stich�s arguments nicely. He
sees the relationship between evolution and rationality as informing problems
aired by Descartes and Hume. Hume�s problem of induction addressed the
impossibility of finding a rational (deductive) argument for why (inductive)
reasoning works. Descartes questioned why self-evident propositions, as
discerned by the natural light of reason, must correspond to reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>how are Descartes and Hume related
here???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After all, if reason and the facts are independent
variables, why should they be correlated at all? Kant responded that since we
cannot show why our reason would conform to objects, it must be that we
perceive the objects to be the way they are because they are constructed by our
faculties. In other words, our knowledge is not of things in themselves, but
only of an empirical reality shaped by our constitution. Kant termed this
upheaval a �Copernican revolution�, although confusingly, in contrast to
Copernicus� effect on astronomy, Kant is reaffirming an anthropomorphic
perspective on the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nozick is overturning the Kantian dependence of the facts on
reason. His �evolutionary hypothesis� amounts to saying that it is reason that
is the dependent variable, shaped by the facts. Our inferential system has
evolved to become specialised for common past situations and stabilities in our
environment. He suggests that there was selection for recognising as valid
certain kinds of connections that are factual, which come to seem to us as more
than just factual. Thus, the neural architecture for a given factual connection
that appears regularly and stably in our environment may be modified over
evolutionary time so that our descendants learn it faster. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, �reason tells us about reality, because reality shapes
reason, selecting for what seems �evident��. However, just because a certain
factual connection has been consistent in the past and we have evolved to see
it as a vaild and increasingly self-evident basis for inference, does not
guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. Moreover, the question
is not just whether the stable regularities of the past continue to hold in the
future, but also whether evolution has picked out the �right� regularities or
given us �green� in a �grue� world. We may come to see the given sequence of
thought as increasingly self-evidently certain (because we are selected to do
so, because in a stable world such semi-automatic inference-making is
adaptive), but this does not guarantee that it ever was strictly true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Importantly then, he is not saying that it is the capacity
to recognise independently existing valid rational connections that is selected
for. Rationality can be seen as a biological adaptation with a function. It was
never the function of rationality to justify certain of our most basic, stable,
useful assumptions, because all we needed was to utilise them as trust-worthy,
predictive regularities. These basic, sub-rational assumptions include the list
of philosophical problems we�ve been least successful with: the problems of
induction; of other minds; of the external world; and of justifying
rationality. It initially seems as though this wholly undermines any claims to
objectivity through reason, though in fact Nozick is keen to defend against
seeing this as the consequence of his arguments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may still be able to sharpen our goals and procedures
though, at least to some extent. Evolutionary theorising may help us understand
what sort of rational system would be adaptive, and consequently why our
rational system is the way it is. The fact that rationality wasn�t designed to
justify itself or its framework assumptions does not mean that it can�t, or
that we can�t turn our rationality upon itself. Rationality is self-conscious,
in that it attempts to correct biases in the information it is supplied, and in
its processes of reasoning. Nozick claims that �Whatever the initial functions
of reasons were, we can use our ability to employ reasons to formulate new
properties of reasons and to shape our utilisation of reasons to exhibit these
properties. According to Nozick, we can, that is, modify and alter the
functions of reasons, and hence of rationality.� After all, although
psychological experiments show how often most people fail to reason well, for
example about probability, the very fact that we have been able (through
centuries of reflection) to formalise and so correct such faulty reasoning
lends hope to improving upon these biologically-instilled assumptions, e.g.
Euclidean geometry.</p>

<h2>What can the objectivist reply to the subjectivising arguments of
evolutionary theory?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Nozick stresses that his evolutionary account of
why we find certain thought processes rationally self-evident does not provide
a reason-independent explanation of reason, since after all, �the evolutionary
explanation itself is something we arrive at, in part, by the use of reason to
support evolutionary theory in general and also this particular application of
it � Hence, the account is not part of first philosophy; it is part of our
current ongoing scientific view.�<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a>
By conceding a lower epistemic status for the account, he avoids any
circularity in his explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, although Nozick regards his account as a �proposal
of a possible naturalistic explanation of the existence of reason that would,
if it were true, make our reliance on reason �objectively� reasonable�, I think
that Nagel is right to feel that �the idea that our rational capacity was the
product of natural selection would render reasoning far less trustworthy than
Nozick suggests�. As he says, in order for his objectivist position to hold, �I
have to be able to believe that the evolutionary explanation is consistent with
the proposition that I follow the rules of logic because they are correct � not
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>merely</i> because I am biologically
programmed to do so�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagel�s response to this and every evolutionary account is
to regard any subjectivising evolutionary explanation of reason as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i> self-defeating. He follows
Plantinga in saying that �it is irrational to accept evolutionary naturalism,
because if it were true, we would have no reason to rely on the methods by
which we arrive at it or any other scientific theory�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a>
�The recognition of logical arguments as independently valid is a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>precondition</i> of the acceptability of an
evolutionary story about the source of that recognition�. As a result, he
concludes that any evolutionary explanation of rationality is necessarily
incomplete. Even an account that is compatible with his objectivism can play no
epistemic role in a justification of reason, unless it can be grounded itself
on a basis other than that which it is seeking to prove.</p>

<h2>Where does this conflict between naturalism and the a priori leave us?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this leaves us in an unsatisfactory limbo. Nagel is
prepared to admit that he doesn�t have a proper positive response to the
question of how we can �integrate such an attitude towards reason with the fact
that we are members of a biological species whose evolution has been shaped by
the contingencies of natural selection�. He seems to place his hope in the thought
that �it is possible that rationality � the capacity to recognise objectively
valid reasons and arguments � is a distinctively accessible member of the set
of biological possibilities, one that becomes likely at sufficiently high
levels of biological complexity�. He understates the truth when he says that
�the theory of evolution as usually understood provides absolutely no support
for this conception of ourselves [�as rational � and also as creatures who have
been produced through Darwinian evolution�], and to some extent it renders the
conception suspect.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An evolutionary argument which did make an objectivist
account of rationality less mysterious would be reassuring, but still would not
�underwrite� our use of reason in a reason-independent way. Ultimately,
according to Nagel, �naturalistic accounts of reasoning� seek an external
�understanding of the world [which] could close over itself by including us and
our methods of thought and understanding within its scope�, but �this hope
cannot be realised, because the primary position will always be occupied by our
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>employment</i> of reason and
understanding � even when we make reasoning the object of our investigation�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Interestingly, coming from a very different angle, the
structure of Pinker�s theory about the evolutionary origins of our reasoning
capacities dovetails nicely with Nagel�s speculative requirements for an
objectivist-compatible evolutionary account:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
     tab-stops:.5in'>a �general analysis� of rationality �into a limited set of
     functional elements�</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3;
     tab-stops:.5in'>considering �the relation between this set of capacities
     and the simpler habits of mind that might plausibly have carried selective
     advantage in the period when the human brain evolved�</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, it is ambiguous whether Pinker�s theory supports a
fully objectivist picture of rationality, because he is more interested in how
our natural scientific propensities differ from the academic approach. His aim
is to show how an evolutionary account can explain modern empirical experiments
showing the limitations and successes of people�s reasoning, as well as
considering the original adaptive role of the faculties we can use for science,
maths, chess etc. He argues that we �[build] parochial inference models that
exploit eons-old regularities in their own subject matters�, e.g. �recognising
objects, making tools, learning the local language, finding a mate, predicting
an animal�s movement, finding [our] way� � the �subject-specific intelligence
of our species� that Tooby and Cosmides<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a>
call �ecological rationality�. He argues in terms of both internal and external
fitness (though not in those terms) that our brains have been shaped for
fitness, not for truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following Jackendoff, he considers these sentences (amongst
many others):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>The messenger <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>went from</i> Paris <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal>Pinker argues that our entire linguistic faculty is based on
concrete inferential machinery that has been co-opted to represent new, more
abstract domains. The concepts of space and force �appear to be the vocabulary
and syntax of mentalese, the [combinatorial] language of thought�. He
speculates whether if �ancestral circuits for reasoning about space and force
were copied, the copy�s connections to the eyes and muscles were severed and
references to the physical world were bleached out�, �the circuits could serve
as a scaffolding whose slots are filled with symbols for more abstract concerns
like states, possessions, ideas and desires�. As evidence, he considers Premack�s
experiments on chimps which showed that they could pick out the object which
plays a causal role linking before-and-after pictures. Also, �space and force
metaphors have been reinvented time and again in dozens of language families
across the globe�. �Preschool children spontaneously coin their own metaphors
in which space and motion symbolise possession, communication, time and
causation� (Bowerman), e.g. �Can I have any reading behind the dinner?�. Thus,
our minds aren�t really adapted to think about arbitrary abstract entities, so
much as having inherited �a pad of forms that capture the key features of
encounters among objects and forces, and the features of other consequential
themes of the human condition such as fighting, food and health�. We can adapt
these inherited forms to more abstruse domains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar way, mathematician Sanders Mac Lane followed
Nagel�s two-part prescription of breaking rationality up into functional
elements and considering what selective advantages these modules might have
had. Mac Lane �speculated that basic human activities were the inspiration for
every branch of mathematics�:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But we may not be biologically designed for (and it would be
surprising if we were) large number words, large sets, the base-10 system,
fractions, multicolumn addition, carrying, multiplication/division, radicals
and exponents. These skills develop slowly and unevenly, perhaps by applying
the sense of number to things that at first feel like the wrong kind of subject
matter, and by practicing (chunking and automaticity � fitting together
over-learned routines).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anything, Pinker�s success at expounding a probably
non-objectivist account while more or less adhering to Nagel�s prescription
highlights the difficulty for an objectivist of explaining how objective
rationality would/could conceivably have evolved. Indeed, Nagel�s position at
the end of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Last Word</i> seems
somewhat analogous to his �explanatory gap� position in philosophy of mind,
where current naturalistic accounts are insufficient to ground rationality in
the way that it requires, i.e. �simply in itself � that is, believing what it <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>tells</i> me, in virtue of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>content</i> of the arguments it delivers�.
Unfortunately though, I find his objectivist instincts about reason
considerably less defensible and intuitively evident. In this case, however, he
does have the luxury of being able to strike down any subjectivising accounts
as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i> self-defeating, no matter
how much more plausible, predictive, explanatorily powerful and integrated with
the rest of our world picture such accounts may be.</p>
