<h3>From <a href="http://neurogenesis.iord.org/">http://neurogenesis.iord.org/</a></h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In order for new <a href="brain.html">brain</a> cells to develop, multipotent
<a href="neural%20stem%20cells.html">neural stem cells</a> divide in the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> and develop into
either neurons or <a href="glia.html">glia</a>. In order to mature, the cells move
away from the multipotent cells, and many die. Those that
make connections with neurons survive. It takes over a
month for the new <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> to be able to send and receive
messages, showing that <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a> is a controlled
process. Neurogenesis is regulated by growth factors that
can lead to the development of new cells. Once the cells
become either glial cells or neurons, other growth factors
including <a href="brain.html">brain</a>-derived neurotrophic factor keep the cells
alive.(7)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In the 1960's and 1970's, researchers discovered that some
parts of the adult <a href="brain.html">brain</a> can repair itself. A number of
studies during this time found that the axons of the
neurons in the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> and <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> can regrow to some
degree after trauma. More recently, in 1998, Eriksson and
colleagues studied postmortem human <a href="brain.html">brain</a> tissue and found
that new neurons were generated in the human <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>,
an area of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> that helps regulate <a href="memory.html">memory</a> and
<a href="learning.html">learning</a>.(4) Researchers have also found that <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a>
occurs in adult mice, birds, and other primates. A 1997
study conducted by Kemperman and Gage found that adult
mice given enriched living conditions showed a sixty
percent increase in new cell growth in the <a href="dentate%20gyrus.html">dentate gyrus</a>
than the control animals. The animals also did better on
<a href="learning.html">learning</a> tasks than the control mice. (9) Scientists are
now studying how <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a> occurs naturally, and how it
can be used to aid in various medical treatments.</p>
