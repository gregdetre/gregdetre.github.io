<h3>Definition</h3>

<p class="first">communicate using a highly structured stream of sounds (or
manual/facial gestures)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">serialization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>rolls: symbols bound by a syntax</p>


<h4>Word</h4>

<p class="first">word = arbitrary association between a sound and a meaning</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">by age 6, children comprehend 13,000 words</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">high school graduates know c. 60,000</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">i.e. children learn a new word every 90 minutes</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>Grammar</h4>

<p class="first">grammar =</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">system that specifies how vocabulary units can be combined
into words, phrases and sentences</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">and how the meanings of a combination can be determined by
the meanings onf the units and the way they're arranged</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3 components to grammar</p>

<ul>
<li>morphology</li>

<li>syntax</li>

<li>phonology</li>
</ul>



<h4>Morphology</h4>

<p class="first">morphology = rules for combining words and affixes into
larger words, e.g. bite + s</p>



<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p class="first">syntax = rules for combining words into phrases and
sentences and determining relationships among words</p>

<ul>
<li>grouping sequences of words into phrases</li>

<li>verb specifies the semantic roles of its arguments</li>

<li>two phrases in a sentence can be linked to refer to the
same entity in the world

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">cf anaphora, deep vs surface structure</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>



<h4>Phonology</h4>

<p class="first">phonology = rules for combining sounds into a consistent
pattern</p>

<p>incl prosody (intonation, <a href="stress.html">stress</a>, timing over
phrases/snetences)</p>




<h3>Development</h3>

<p class="first">8-10 months</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">ability to comprehend (+ produce) individual words</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10 months</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">may understand the meaning of a word without being able to
articulate it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>12 months</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">comprehension vocabulary of about 100 words (+/- half/twice)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">production vocabulary of about 10 words (though some don't
till 20 months)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>24 months</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">average production vocabulary &gt; 300 (Å± half/twice)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[all such studies (the largest had 1800 infants) rely on
parental assessments (with checklists + guidelines), which
can be subjective]</p>



<h3>Innateness</h3>

<p class="first">what is innate? (<a href="ks4.html">ks4</a> 1173)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;some kind of neural system that analyzes communicative
signals from other people ... according to the design of
language&quot;</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Animal <a href="language.html">language</a></h3>

<p class="first">natural communication systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>finite repertoire of calls</li>

<li>continuous nalaog signal to register magnitude of some
condition</li>

<li>sequences of randomly ordered response that serve as
variations on a theme (birdsong)</li>
</ul>

<p>no discrete, infinite combinatioral systems of meaningful
elements</p>



<h3>Evolution</h3>

<p class="first">300,000 generations (6-8m years) between humans and chimps
for <a href="language.html">language</a> to evolve</p>

<p>two factors of hominid lifestyle may have spurred evolution
<a href="language.html">language</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>developed technology to exploit the environment in their
lifetimes</li>

<li>extensive cooperation</li>
</ul>

<p>gordon holmes - parietal (esp. right) - spatial +
attentional deficits</p>


<p>why has the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> evolved asymmetrically?</p>


<p>theory that stuttering emerges in people with bilateral
<a href="language.html">language</a> representation and that they compete with each
other</p>


<p>penrose - stimulation to find the regions in the left
hemisphere that cause speech arrest - very large region
encompassing broca's and wernicke's area</p>

<p>lotto test to figure out <a href="language.html">language</a> lateralisation</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">count backwards from 100 in 3s - cannula into both sides
of neck - infuse anaesthetic (barbiturate)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">you can tell if it's taking effect because if you inject
into right side, left arm wilts - but the person carries
on speaking</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">whereas if you inject on the other side, the speech stops</p>
</blockquote>

<p>geschwind - anatomical test for <a href="language.html">language</a> area - look to see
how big the hemispheres are</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">did graziano say that when you're better at <a href="language.html">language</a>,
your cortex is bigger???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">apparently it's built in from birth - genetic</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">also present in gorillas</p>
</blockquote>


<p>analysis cro-magnon cave paintings of hands - paint around
your hand - 90% appeared to be right handed</p>

<p>baboons - get hit from behind on the head - the bash is
usually on the right side</p>

<p>chimps - appears to be roughly 50-50 in the entire
population - though there might be a slight statistical
trend towards right-handedness</p>

<p>this debunks the sword and shield hypothesis - right handers
would have the shield on the heart side</p>


<p>no evidence for extra right side visual field
representation???</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">n, nor tactile sensitivity</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but you do see some distinctions in motor representations
<ul>
<li>handedness - specialisation in holding vs action</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>split-<a href="brain.html">brain</a> technique</p>

<blockquote>

help</p>

<p class="quoted">if you sever the optic chiasm sagitally, you'd only have
half a visual field in each eye</p>

wear an eyepatch while training a cat on go-no go task</p>

<p class="quoted">then when he switched the eyepatch, it was like the cat
had never seen the task before</p>

<p class="quoted">mary: lateral/contralateral paw?</p>

<p>apparently primates have some ipsilateral control</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">tried on monkeys - as though had two brains - train on
different things</p>

<center>
<p>but no obvious emotional or behavioural effect</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">joe bogen - tried it on humans</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">this time make a more complete lesion - maybe the
problem with the first set of corpus callosum lesions
was that they were too small</p>

<p>susan: did he do the posterior commisure?</p>

the <a href="epilepsy.html">epilepsy</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">not very popular now, because it's so drastic and
because there are so many drugs that help</p>

<p>chris: when do they remove the entire hemisphere?</p>

<p>do you get unilateral seizures though???</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">apparently y - though they tend not to be grand mal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>reduces the positive feedback if you have no <a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> link
between the hemispheres</p>

<p>has no apparent effect on the personality or intellect -
they feel normal - sometimes you see funny symptoms as
though they have two minds - but these tend to go away
rapidly after a few weeks</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">one patient described going to the closet and one hand
<a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> for a dress and the other one throwing it on the
floor</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">one hand buttoning and the other hand unbuttoning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sperry - tested the humans</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">harder than with cats, because you can't cut the optic
chiasm, so you have to separate the visual fields</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">tachistoscopic presentation - you have to present it
really fast so that if the subject involuntarily <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a>,
the stimulus has already gone</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">present naked woman on one side and patient laughs - but
says that they didn't see anything and doesn't know
why they're laughing - try and make up some excuse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but the right hemisphere has some <a href="language.html">language</a> ability</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">you can tell them to do things and the left hand will do
it - some people say that it's level of comprehension
is at the level of a 5 year old</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but limited speech ability</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">it could spell - you could give him scrabble letters and
so converse with the right hemisphere :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>one hemisphere wanted to be a car mechanic and the other
one wanted to be a racing driver - shared interests :)</p>

<p>right hemisphere tends to be better at spatial relations,
and at reading the emotional content of facial expressions</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">can't draw a cube correctly</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">susan: reversed for left-handers?</p>

<p class="quoted">there are left-handers who are perfect reversals, but
minority</p>

<p>something about faces with tilde-shaped mouthsíÅ°Åƒ???</p></li>

<p>there are people who are naturally split-brained - corpus íÅ°Åƒ
agenesis</p>

<p class="quoted">you'd only know if you did a <a href="brain.html">brain</a> scan on them - and
then you could test it with the tachistoscopic experiment
but otherwise you'd never know</p>

<p>kinsbourne - simultaneous/dual tasks</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">poetry interferes with right hand performance more (when
balancing a stick with one or the other)</p>

balancing the stick, and it will interfere more with your
left hand</p>

analytic, serial tasks, while the right side was better
