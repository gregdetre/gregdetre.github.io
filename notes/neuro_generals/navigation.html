<h2>Navigation</h2>

<h3>In <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a></h3>

<p><a href="place%20cells.html">place cells</a></p>

<p>head direction cells</p>

<p>matt wilson - knows which part of the maze the rat's in
while it's dreaming???</p>


<h4>London taxi drivers</h4>

<p class="first">mcguire - 1997, 2000</p>

<p>the knowledge - 6-mile radius of charing cross - 3 years,
3/4 drop out, 400 prescribed runs</p>

<p>claimed that the longer they were a taxi driver, the
larger the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">grew larger as spent more time on the job</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">on both sides</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">especially the posterior region</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">front of the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> was smaller in taxi drivers</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>May (OHBM 06)</h4>

<p class="first">this is more to do with changes in <a href="brain.html">brain</a> volume than <a href="navigation.html">navigation</a></p>

<p>50 volunteers - controls and medical students, scanned
before and after an examination after 3 months</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">voxel-based morphometry - <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> bigger</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">could be <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a>, though don't know. could just be
that the neurons are bigger, or migration, or <a href="glia.html">glia</a>, or
axonal/dendritical sprouting</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">increase in grey matter can happen as quickly as after a
single week</p>
</blockquote>

<p>why was there further increase in grey matter after 3 months
of doing nothing???</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">shrinks under <a href="stress.html">stress</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so maybe, after the exam is over, and the <a href="stress.html">stress</a> is over,
and so the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> ceases to shrink and so shows
growth</p>
</blockquote>




<h4>How to reconcile space vs declarative <a href="memory.html">memory</a>???</h4>

<p class="first">perhaps rats are just very spatial animals, and primates
worry more about memories</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">nah</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="current.html">current</a> idea is that the two functions are highly related</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">think of places as a conjunction of multiple input stimuli</p>
</blockquote>

<p>different between associations within a cortical area vs
associations between cortical areas</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">episodic vs ltm???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">maybe HM lacks the ability to do the latter - that's
what <a href="episodic%20memory.html">episodic memory</a> is - association between disparate
stimuli, thoughts + context</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">and spatial maps kind of work the same way</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">eichenbaum - early proponent</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">trained rats on a smell task - smell one</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">then given two comparison odours, had to match to
familiar</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">hippocampal neurons were responding to the odours</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">same as the neurons that were place fields in a
spatial context</p>
</blockquote>
