<h2>Echolocation</h2>

<h3>Part of</h3>

<p><a href="auditory%20system.html">auditory system</a></p>



<h3>Mechanism</h3>

<p class="first">uses many of the same sound cues known to be important for
speech (Saga)</p>

<p>the sounds emitted by echolocating bats have two principal
components:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>constant frequency component</em> similar to the formants
in vowel sounds</li>

<li><em>frequency-modulated component</em> similar to the changing
frequencies in consonants</li>
</ul>

<p>between the emitted sound and the echo, bats must
distinguish 16 components to gauge the velocity and
distance of their prey - this is qualitatively similar to
the task of perceiving the subtleties in speech sounds</p>

<p>there is strong evidence that the bat's cerebral cortex
includes areas where harmonic combinations of frequences
are represented - although no such cells have yet been
found in the human <a href="brain.html">brain</a>, they would be ideal detectors of
the multiple frequencies in the speech sounds produced by
the human voice</p>


<p>which animals</p>
