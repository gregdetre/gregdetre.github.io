<h2>Vagus nerve</h2>

<h3>Located in</h3>

<p class="first">from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve">wikipedia</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a> (also called pneumogastric nerve or
cranial nerve X) is the tenth of twelve paired
<a href="cranial%20nerves.html">cranial nerves</a>, and is the only nerve that starts in
the <a href="brainstem.html">brainstem</a> (within the <a href="medulla.html">medulla</a> oblongata) and extends,
through the jugular foramen, down below the head, to the
abdomen. The <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a> is arguably the single most
important nerve in the body.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Function</h3>

<p class="first">&quot;This means that the <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a> is responsible for such
varied tasks as heart rate, gastrointestinal peristalsis,
sweating, and quite a few <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> movements in the mouth,
including speech (via the recurrent laryngeal nerve) and
keeping the larynx open for breathing. It also receives some
sensation from the outer ear, via the Auricular branch (also
known as Alderman's nerve) and part of the meninges.&quot;</p>

<p>wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Symptoms of nervousness, especially in a social context,
such as increased heart rate/palpitation, impediment or
inability to speak, stomach irritation, and excessive
perspiration are caused in part by the <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">An effective method of curbing these symptoms is by
taking a deep breath, and forcefully blowing out through
a small hole in your mouth, letting the cheeks puff
inflate. This puts pressure on the nerve, and tells it
to reset. This technique is also used as a warm-up by
singers.</p>

<h3>Etymology</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve">wikipedia</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The medieval Latin word vagus means literally &quot;wandering&quot;
(the words vagrant, vagabond, and vague come from the same
root). It is also called the pneumogastric nerve since it
innervates both the lungs and the stomach.</p>
