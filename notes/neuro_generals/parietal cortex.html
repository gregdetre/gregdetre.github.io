<h5>Excerpts - Ben Townsend's essay</h5>

<p>The <a href="parietal%20cortex.html">parietal cortex</a> of monkeys is situated caudal to the
postcentral gyrus and superior to the Sylvian fissure. It
can be divided into two major areas:an anterior part,
consisting of the post central gyrus and the caudal bank of
the central sulcus; and a posterior part, which can be
divided into an upper (superior) and lower (inferior) lobule
by the intraparietal sulcus. The anterior part contains
Brodmann's areas 1, 2, 3 and 43 and contains primary
<a href="somatosensory%20cortex.html">somatosensory cortex</a>. The posterior part consists of areas
5a, 5b, 7a, 7b, and the anterior, lateral, medial and
<a href="ventral%20intraparietal.html">ventral intraparietal</a> areas (AIP, LIP, MIP and VIP
respectively). In addition, the area in between the
intraparietal sulcus and the preluneate gyrus contains the
middle temporal (<a href="MT.html">MT</a>) and medial superior temporal (<a href="MST.html">MST</a>)
areas.</p>

<p>Area LIP receives inputs from extrastriate visual areas and
sends outputs to <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> , the <a href="caudate%20nucleus.html">caudate nucleus</a>,
and the <a href="superior%20colliculus.html">superior colliculus</a> - areas of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> concerned
with saccidic <a href="eye%20movements.html">eye movements</a> (Lynch et al 1985, Asanuma et al
1985, Blatt et al 1990). Area 7a has strong cortical
connections with the visual areas, and with the
parahippocampal gyrus and the <a href="cingulate%20cortex.html">cingulate cortex</a>, the latter
two being areas that are concerned with the highest
cognitive functions. Areas 7b and VIP are connected more to
the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> system (Andersen et al, 1990a), but
respond to visual stimuli as well. 7b projects to the
<a href="supplementary%20motor%20area.html">supplementary motor area</a> (SMA) while VIP outputs to the
caudate and the <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a>. Broadly speaking, areas 7a, 7b,
LIP, VIP and <a href="MST.html">MST</a> appear to process information about spatial
relationships.</p>




<h5>Notes - Husain &amp; Jackson (2001), Visual space is not what it appears to be</h5>

<p>Probe stimuli that appear very briefly at a wide range of
stimulus locations immediately prior to the execution of a
saccadic eye movement are not perceived to be in their
veridical positions, but are instead reported to be at
locations compressed towards the target of the saccadic eye
movement - the intended new point of fixation or direction
of gaze. If no saccadic eye movement is planned, then the
location is misreported closer to the point of fixation
(Ross &amp; Morrone, 1997).</p>

<p>The same observations were made when subjects reported the
location of the probe verbally (by calling out a number
corresponding to a visual or memorised scale), just before
making a saccade. When post-saccadic information was not
available, subjects' localisation of the probe stimulus by
pointing was extremely accurate, as were their verbal
reports. However, when the subjects' <a href="vision.html">vision</a> was not
occluded, both pointing and verbal reports demonstrated the
same compression towards the point of fixation or
saccade. Burr et al think this supports the idea of two
separate visual systems, one for conscious perception (more
plastic and subject to spatial distortion) and the other for
the control of action.</p>

<p>Husain &amp; Jackson suggest that 'the findings of Burr et al
are consistent with recent demonstrations of separate neural
systems for representing movements in eye-centerd and
body-centerd coordinates. For example, when some patients
with hemispatial visual neglect following posterior cortical
lesions reach towards visual targets, their trajectories may
be spatially distorted, but this distortion does not occur
when they reach to proprioceptively-defined targets <sup><a name="fnr.8" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>.'</p>

<p>Movements may be planned and controlled within
body-part-centerd coordinate systems, e.g. eye-centerd
representations may be responsible for dynamic remapping
across <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a>, whereas body-centerd representations are
not.</p>

<p>They suggest that these 'compression' effects reside in the
PPC. In the monkey, electrophysiological studies have
identified multiple representations of space within this
area [10-13], each associated with different types or
combinations of action. They suggest <sup><a name="fnr.14" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> that the remapping
going on in LIP while monkeys make saccadic <a href="eye%20movements.html">eye movements</a>
might be from a coordinate system with the initial fixation
point as its origin, to one with the upcoming fixation point
as its origin.</p>

<p>They argue that this eye-centerd remapping may be the
(<a href="unknown.html">unknown</a>) mechanism behind the spatial 'compressive'
effect. 'Some LIP neurons continue to encode both the
original point of fixation as well as the new intended point
of fixation at around the time of the saccade, effectively
encoding space in a coarser representation'. Also, parts of
the LIP appear to be involved in maintaining a <a href="memory.html">memory</a> trace
for the location of saccadic targets across delays.</p>

<p>When the intraparietal sulcus is lesioned in humans, a
profound spatial deficit which Husain &amp; Jackson explain as
an impairment in spatial re-mapping across <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a> when
tested on a double-saccade task [16,17], in that they are
unable to '[make] <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a> commensurate with the original
retinal position of the second target', i.e. failing to take
into account the new eye position after the first
saccade. They suggest that this may account for one
component of the <a href="hemispatial%20neglect.html">hemispatial neglect</a> syndrome which follows
parietal damage.</p>

<p>They then consider the compression seen in visually-guided
pointing movements in healthy humans.</p>

<p>They say that 'recent electrophysiological studies of the
superior parietal lobe have demonstrated the existence of a
'parietal reach region', where 'representations associated
with <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> movements appear to be eye-centerd rather than
body-centerd'. Apparently, visual signals are combined with
hand position and movement signals, as well as eye position
and movement signals, in the parietal reach region.</p>

<p>In humans, lesions of the SPL lead to misreaching to
peripheral visual targets - <a href="optic%20ataxia.html">optic ataxia</a>. They're able to
reach towards proprioceptively-defined targets, but not
visual stimuli (especially targets in their peripheral
<a href="vision.html">vision</a>). When <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> to peripheral visual targets while
fixating centrally, they err towards the direction of gaze,
'magnetic misreaching'. They speculate that this extreme
compression 'may result from an imbalance between visual
representations arising from the <a href="fovea.html">fovea</a> and those originating
from the peripheral <a href="retina.html">retina</a>.</p>

<p>They argue that the veridical pointing without visual input
is explicable because such movements towards remembered
locations would not be coded in eye-centerd but in
body-centerd (proprioceptive) coordinates (found in areas 5
and 7b). Consistent with this, lesions of these regions lead
to misreaching in the dark, but not the light.</p>

<p>the model is faster in the neutral condition when you turn
