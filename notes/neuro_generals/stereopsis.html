<h2>Stereopsis</h2>

<p class="first">at distances greater than about 100 feet, the retinal images
seen by each eye are almost identical</p>

<h3>Neurophysiological approaches to <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a></h3>

<p class="first">Neurophysiological approaches to <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> tend to be
structured in terms of the anatomical area(s) being
investigated. It seems clear that binocular information is
not brought together earlier than <a href="V1.html">V1</a> (see Xue et al, 1987
for a discussion of the lack of disparity-selective cells in
the LGN), so neurophysiologists can focus on striate and
extrastriate cortical areas.</p>

<p>One of the main problems facing researchers into the
physiology of <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> is being sure that neuronal
activity that seems to be correlated with psychophysical
reports is actually involved in <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> processing. After
<a href="V1.html">V1</a>, there are numerous areas which combine binocular inputs
and can be broadly described as disparity-selective. Parker
&amp; Newsome (1988) stipulate three conditions for regarding a
<a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> as really contributing to the performance of a given
stereoscopic task:</p>

<ol>
<li>neuronal activity should be recorded during
performance of the task, and it should be shown that the
candidate neurons are sufficiently sensitive to mediate
task perforamcne</li>

<li>neuronal activity should be shown to covary with
perceptual judgements near psychophysical threshold</li>

<li>artificial manipulation of neuronal activity
(activation or suppression) should alter performance of
the task</li>
</ol>

<p>These criteria take into account the second difficulty of
<a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> experiments, that of isolating binocular from
monocular effects. After all, whenever the visual signals
are altered to test a stereoptic hypothesis, the input to
one or both eyes necessarily changes too, and we need to be
sure that we are not mistaking neuronal activity related to
this monocular change for <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a>-related
processing. Random dot stereograms provide one means of
distinguishing binocular from monocular effects, since any
resulting disparity selective activity must relate to
binocular correlation. Using a dichoptic bar stimulus in all
possible combinations of positions in the two eyes (Ohzawa
et al 1990) also differentiates between monocular and
binocular effects.</p>

<p><a href="V1.html">V1</a> is the first area in the visual system where signals from
both eyes are integrated. However, single <a href="V1.html">V1</a> neurons do not
seem to be able to account for the conscious perception of
<a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> (Cumming and Parker 1997), even though they do
definitely signal the disparity of a stimulus, as shown
initially with sweeping bar stimuli in anesthetized cats
(Pettigrew et al 1968, Barlow et al 1967). In order to
establish how complex <a href="V1.html">V1</a> neurons’¡Ç role in <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a>
processing is, anticorrelated RDSs (like a normal RDS, but
with the contrast inverted in one of the images) are used,
because ’¡Èthe pattern of local matches they produce appears
to be rivalrous with no consistent <a href="depth.html">depth</a>, except at low dot
densities (&lt;5%)’¡É. The disparity ’¡Æenergy’¡Ç model proposes
that <a href="complex%20cells.html">complex cells</a> fire when the <a href="simple%20cells.html">simple cells</a> are activated
by a disparity. As predicted by this model, aRDSs give rise
to an inverted disparity function response (Cumming and
Parker 1997), indicating that <a href="V1.html">V1</a> performs only a preliminary
role in <a href="depth.html">depth</a> processing.</p>

<p>Disparity selectivity has been noted in monkeys in various
extrastriate areas, including <a href="V2.html">V2</a>, V3, V3A, VP, <a href="MT.html">MT</a>, <a href="MST.html">MST</a>, IT
and some visuomotor regions of the parietal and frontal
cortex. Evidence from humans implicates all of these areas
to a greater or lesser degree (e.g. Hubel and Livingstone
(1987); <a href="DeAngelis.html">DeAngelis</a> and Newsome (1999); Uka et al. (2000)),
including a notably ordered disparity representation in <a href="MT.html">MT</a>
(<a href="DeAngelis.html">DeAngelis</a>, Cumming and Newsome (1998)). Vania’¡Çs broad
overview of the neurological evidence indicates that
occipital/parietal areas were important for establishing
binocular correspondence but that occipital/temporal areas
were needed to extract the three dimensional <a href="shape.html">shape</a>.</p>




<h3>Definitions</h3>
<a name="disparity" id="disparity"></a>
disparity = expressed in terms of the difference in the
angle between the line of sight and the line to the object
for the two eyes. a further computation is required to
ocnvert disparity into distance from the viewer, but this is
straightforward.
