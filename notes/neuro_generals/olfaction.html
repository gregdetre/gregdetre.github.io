<h3>Definition</h3>

<p class="first">sense of smell</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p class="first">from <a href="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course/limbic.html">http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course/limbic.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The <a href="olfactory%20system.html">olfactory system</a> actually begins in the roof of the nasal cavity. The olfactory receptors are ciliated epithelial cells with an array of receptors capable of detecting thousands of different odors.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">However, just as with any sensory system, the <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a>
neurons themselves do not project to the cerebral
hemispheres. Their axons project up through the cribiform
plate of the skull to <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> on the dendrites of the
mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. The axons of the
olfactory receptors make up the elusive cranial nerve
I. This fragile tract is susceptible to shearing forces in
head trauma, and loss of smell is a surprisingly
debilitating injury.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Here is an example of a section through olfactory
bulb. The olfactory bulb is not a simple relay (something
which passively transmits the signal), but is a
sophisticated structure in itself. The mitral cell-
olfactory <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> is actually within a tangle of
axons and dendrites that is called a glomerulus. There is
a second cell type tucked around these glomeruli which
probably affects how the signal is transmitted. These
cells are small and densely packed, which gives them the
name &quot;granule cells&quot;. However, they bear no relation to
the <a href="granule%20cells.html">granule cells</a> of the <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a> or <a href="cerebral%20cortex.html">cerebral cortex</a>. In
fact, they are <a href="GABA.html">GABA</a>-ergic, unlike other cells of the same
name.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">There are two populations of <a href="granule%20cells.html">granule cells</a> in the
olfactory bulb - the external, or periglomerular cells,
and the internal <a href="granule%20cells.html">granule cells</a>. The latter lie deep to the
mitral cell layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The mitral cell axons travel back to the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> via the
olfactory tract. The main target of the olfactory tract is
the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal
lobe. However, the sense of smell is heavily
interconnected with all parts of the <a href="limbic%20system.html">limbic system</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Does anything about this system strike you as odd? The
<a href="olfactory%20system.html">olfactory system</a> disobeys a general rule of sensory
systems - it does not have to pass through <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> before
<a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> cortex. However, there is a very good reason why
not; olfactory cortex is an old and primitive structure,
and in fact has only four cellular layers, unlike the
6-layered cortex we are accustomed to. The rule that
sensory information must pass through <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> to get to
<a href="cerebral%20cortex.html">cerebral cortex</a> is still true, but only for 6-layered
cortex, or neocortex. This description applies to almost
every area in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and
temporal lobes.</p>
