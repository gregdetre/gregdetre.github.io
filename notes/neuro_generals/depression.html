<h2>Depression</h2>

<p class="first">BDI = Beck Depression Inventory - questionnaire</p>

<p>SSSRIs increase levels of 5-HT in the nervous system
(Anderson et al, 2005)</p>



<p>from <a href="http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=00083A00-318C-1F30-9AD380A84189F2D7">sapolsky</a> on <a href="stress.html">stress</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In contrast to anxiety, which can feel like desperate
hyperactivity, major <a href="depression.html">depression</a> is characterized by
helplessness, despair, an exhausted sense of being too
overwhelmed to do anything (psychomotor retardation) and a
loss of feelings of pleasure. Accordingly, <a href="depression.html">depression</a> has
a different biology and requires some different strategies
for treatment. But it, too, can be related to <a href="stress.html">stress</a>, and
there is ample evidence of this association. First of all,
psychological <a href="stress.html">stress</a> entails feeling a loss of control and
predictability&mdash;an accurate description of
<a href="depression.html">depression</a>. Second, major stressful events seem to precede
depressive episodes early in the course of the
disease. Finally, treating people with glucocorticoid
hormones to control conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis can lead to <a href="depression.html">depression</a>.</p>
