<h2>Primary auditory cortex</h2>

<h3>Aka</h3>

<p><a href="A1.html">A1</a></p>



<h3>Located in</h3>

<p><a href="superior%20temporal%20gyrus.html">superior temporal gyrus</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">(<a href="BA.html">BA</a> 41 and 42)</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Consists of</h3>



<h3>Inputs from</h3>

<p><a href="medial%20geniculate%20nucleus.html">medial geniculate nucleus</a> (into layer 4)</p>

<p>binaural - gets inputs from both ears (not directly though???)</p>



<h3>Sends to</h3>

<p class="first">back to <a href="medial%20geniculate%20nucleus.html">medial geniculate nucleus</a> (from layer 5)</p>

<p>also to <a href="inferior%20colliculus.html">inferior colliculus</a> (layer 6)</p>



<h3>Other connections</h3>

<p class="first">important callosal connections</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">zones that do and don't receive them are interspersed</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p class="first">3 primaryish areas of auditory cortex</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">cochleotopically organised</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">highly responsive to pure tones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>surrounding belt of about 7 areas</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">less precisely cochleotopic</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">generally more responsive to complex stimuli than tones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>rostral and caudal divisions of a parabelt region</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">at a third level of processing in the cortex lateral to
the belt</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">connect with regions of temporal, parietal and frontal
cortex that mediate additional auditory functions,
including space perception and auditory <a href="memory.html">memory</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>belt and parabelt regions</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">additional inputs from</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">dorsal and <a href="magnocellular.html">magnocellular</a> divisions of the medial
geniculate complex and other parts of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">appear to be concerned with integrative and associative
functions involved in pattern perception and object
recognition</p>
</blockquote>




<h3>From prosem</h3>

<p class="first">bands emphasising one <a href="ear.html">ear</a> over the other</p>

<p>if you lesion it, people can still hear to some extent -
can definitely still localise - pattern recognition
impaired</p>

<p>but people are just presenting pure tones to different
ears - no wonder this is the organisation they see</p>

<p>asif gazanfar(???) - auditory processing in monkeys</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">have people tried playing patterns of sounds???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">y, gazanfar tried playing behaviourally meaningful
sounds backwards - no response, even though they
have the same frequency characteristics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>right around wernicke's area</p>

<p>can increase the representation in auditory cortex of a
frequency by training</p>

<p>the frequencies bats need for <a href="echolocation.html">echolocation</a> are massively
over-represented here</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">brother-in-law increased sensitivity through training
to F# (beginning of Chopin's prelude) - probably
<a href="hearing.html">hearing</a> it everywhere</p>
</blockquote>

<p>doesn't it seem kind of strange that we don't have
perfect pitch, given that we have fixed upper and lower
range and tonotopic in between???</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">he suggested that our cortical tonotopic map (of which
we're more likely to be conscious) may shift much more
than the more fixed lower tonotopic maps</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">digital piano - shift the whole thing up half a tone -
people can tell it feels wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>singers' motor <a href="memory.html">memory</a> - can produce right note, but can't
identify it aurally</p>




<h3>Organization</h3>

<p class="first">functionally organised into columns - binaural cells are
found clustered into two alternating columnar groups,
<em>summation columns</em> and <em>suppression columns</em>, running from
the pial surface to the underlying white matter</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">in summation columns, the response of a cell to binaural
input is greater than to monaural input</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">in suppression columns, input from one <a href="ear.html">ear</a> is dominant;
the response of a cell to input from the dominant <a href="ear.html">ear</a> is
greater than to binaural input - columns of this kind may
be related to spatial maps of <a href="sound%20localization.html">sound localization</a> in the
cortex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>extensive inputs from each <a href="ear.html">ear</a> in both hemispheres, so
unilateral lesions of the auditory cortex do not
dramatically disrupt the perception of sound frequency
(though they do affect the ability to localise sounds
slightly). Each hemisphere is concerned mainly with
localising sounds on the contralateral side.</p>




<h3>Details</h3>

<p class="first">multiple tonotopic maps</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">systematic frequency representation (all frequencies are
roughly equally represented in humans)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">isofrequency columns perpendicular to cortical surface,
arranged in tonotopic bands</p>
</blockquote>

<p>apparently involved in conscious sound perception</p>



<h3>From oxford notes</h3>

<h4>Binaural</h4>

<p class="first">inputs from the two ears are combined by
ascending pathways that cross the midline extensively</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">timing and intensity of signals kept separate until
auditory cortex</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">map of timing, intensity and frequency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>auditory cortex of location, loudness and pitch.</p>




<h4>Tonotopic organization</h4>

<p class="first">in</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="primary%20auditory%20cortex.html">primary auditory cortex</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">some divisions of the belt area</p>
</blockquote>

<p>iso-frequency strips lie at right angles to the line of
frequency progression</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">there do not appear to be sudden jumps in frequency as an
electrode is moved tangentially in the cortex</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>Binaural dominance</h4>

<p class="first">Binaural dominance does seem to be related to the existence
of discrete columns</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">cells of the same binaural
dominance lie in the same radial direction in the cortex</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">segregated into discrete strips, running along the
cortical surface at roughly right angles to the
iso-frequency strips</p>
</blockquote>

<p>many cells in <a href="primary%20auditory%20cortex.html">primary auditory cortex</a> show binaural
interactions, suggesting that they code for sound direction</p>



<h4>Representation</h4>

<p class="first">not all neurons in the <a href="primary%20auditory%20cortex.html">primary auditory cortex</a> show
responses to sound</p>

<p>various shapes of tuning curves in the primary
auditory cortex</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">e.g. broad, multi-peaked, with complex temporal patterns
of response</p>
</blockquote>

<p>each cortex predominantly represents sound sources on the
contralateral side</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">some cells seem specifically responsive to
frequency-modulated stimuli</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">others respond only to complex sounds such as animal calls</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">though they are not specific detectors for these so much
as responding to their basic acoustic elements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AI seems heavily implicated in <a href="sound%20localization.html">sound localization</a>. Sound
locus is coded in a frequency-specific way, such that each
iso-frequency strip is involved in coding the source locus
for sounds of that frequency.</p>

<p>the auditory cortex seems to affect the ability to attend
to sounds in the contralateral <a href="ear.html">ear</a></p>

<p>may be necessary for auditory short-term <a href="memory.html">memory</a>, and
prolonging the effects of short stimuli</p>

<p>Hypotheses about auditory function:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">necessary for the analysis of complex sounds</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">subserves <a href="sound%20localization.html">sound localization</a> and the representation of
'auditory space'</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">necessary for selective <a href="attention.html">attention</a> to auditory stimuli on
the basis of source position</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">serves to inhibit inappropriate motor responses</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">serves to identify stimuli on an absolute basis</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">necessary for the discrimination of auditory temporal
patterns</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">necessary for short-term <a href="memory.html">memory</a> when one auditory stimulus
has to be related to another later in time</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">necessary for difficult auditory tasks</p>
</blockquote>




<h4>Cortical lesion studies</h4>

<p class="first">initially seemed to show that</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">frequency discrimination is
impossible after complete lesions of the auditory
cortex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>however</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">frequency discrimination in a series of
ongoing pips appears to be possible</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">while other forms of frequency discrimination are not</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">apparently purely as a result of task difficulty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>affected</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">tasks where the animals have to utilise the temporal
dimension of auditory stimuli, or detect/discriminate very
short stimuli</p>
</blockquote>
