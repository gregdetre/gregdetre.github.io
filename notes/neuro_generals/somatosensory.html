<h3><a name="sec4" id="sec4"></a>
From tutorial - Iles, <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a></h3>

<p class="first">somatosens NN - harder because you can't feed it input so
easily</p>

<p>generally hard to reproduce stimuli</p>



<p>don't forget hair follicles, e.g. in hair animals</p>

<p><a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> system mor eheterogenous than other systems</p>

<p>e.g. star-nosed mole - nasal protuberances filled with
mechanoreceptors</p>

<p>helps detect vibrations of insect inside burrow</p>

<p>tactile forces</p>



<p>microneurography - microstimulation</p>

<p>sharpened tungsten electrode into nerve + record from single
unit</p>

<p>very difficult if there are any movements - tedious</p>

<p>once recording, use it to stimulate</p>

<p>appears that the unit you stimulate affects just recording
from</p>

<p>ask the subject what they report</p>



<p>RA2 = PC, SA2 = Ruffini</p>

<p>1 = small receptive field, 2 = big</p>

<p>19th century histology, stain with silver, hence naming</p>

<p>not easy to square up the 4 physiologies with histology</p>

<p>mesentery - connective tissue holding guts etc. - contains
PC</p>

<p>difficult to distinguish SA1-Merkel and RA1-Meissner</p>



<p>crossing - <a href="medulla.html">medulla</a> vs gracile-cuneate???</p>

<p>also descending pathway down the lemniscular sysm, though it
may be more direct</p>

<p>in vis system, there are more connections back from cortex
to LGN than into it from <a href="retina.html">retina</a> - in awake animal, acts to
control the transmission at a higher level - like an
attentive mechanism</p>

<p>somatosens - analogous with dorsal col nuclei perhaps</p>



<p>skin stretch - glue threads linking 2 fingers + pull -
subjects report fingers flexing</p>

<p>Ruffini plays kinesthetic role</p>



<p>PC - other animals don't use tools, but monkeys have them</p>

<p>also just signal that something has happened when you touch
something - and on a wide scale because large receptive
field - what might they do with them???</p>

<p>hair + Meissner - flutter</p>

<p>also vibrissae</p>

<p>biophysics of ion <a href="channels.html">channels</a> in hair follicles - new
information</p>

<p>gene family of degenerins in mouse genome - if knocked out,
they can still hear, but one of the <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> types in hairs
stops working, so probably &gt;1 hair <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> type</p>

<p>skin hierarchy 3b, 1, SII</p>

<p>Kaas - topograph representation more complicated - separate
maps, clearest in 3b, less clear in 2 because <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>
afferents etc.</p>

<p>reason for &gt;1 map is that they represent different
information</p>

<p>parallel processing</p>

<p>in vis sysm, the topographic representation is retained a
small way down the parallel paths</p>

<p>Iles thinks there's quite a lot of hierarchy built into the
system</p>

<p>divergent streams of processing</p>

<p><a href="auditory%20system.html">auditory system</a> is parallel from early on, primary and
cortex</p>

<p>3 topographic maps, then 2 parallel - what + where</p>

<p>usually believed that the spinothalamic (anterolateral)
(<a href="pain.html">pain</a>, temperature + touch) system is í°ƒ more ancient than
lemniscal</p>

<p>spinal injury impairs complex touch, not anaesthetic</p>



<p>PPC also involved in motor control</p>

<p>mechanoreceptors' role in object manipulation + surface
analysis</p>

<p>different functional stream - see fMRI - separate areas for
<a href="shape.html">shape</a> + roughness (Roland et al 1998)</p>

<p>different tasks Åﬁ different parts of PPC</p>

<p>length/<a href="shape.html">shape</a>/roughness with hand - motor task, hence PPC</p>

<p>passive non-motor task would have been interesting</p>

<p>potential for fMRI to continue to improve is good</p>

<p>need bigger magnets, bigger computers, head stabilisation</p>

<p>even 1mm or so is too rough for columnar organisation</p>



<p>from PPC ÅÆ ventral pre-motor areas ÅÆ <a href="primary%20motor%20cortex.html">primary motor cortex</a> ÅÆ
<a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a></p>

<p>kinesthesia - sensing limb position + movement - many are
propriocepttive receptors (joints + muscles) but some are
cutaneous - straddles touch + <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a></p>

<p><a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a> defined in terms of <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> (responds to
position/movements of body parts)</p>



<p>are layers 5+6 part of S1??? y (not Brodmann's area)</p>

<p>all of neocortex has 6-layered architecture</p>

<p>difficult to differentiate cytoarchitecturally</p>

<p>outputs to <a href="striatum.html">striatum</a> - <a href="striatum.html">striatum</a> is involved in motor control</p>

<p>(we can tell through lesions: Parkinson's, Huntingdon's
(degeneration of <a href="striatum.html">striatum</a>)), but indirectly</p>

<p><a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a> (some down spine) but mainly to cortex (mainly
pre-motor + planning)</p>



<p><a href="vision.html">vision</a> what stream &lt;<code>&gt; surface analysis (e.g. wood/smooth)

don't know how linked to somatosens

do know about motor - some visual illusions fool ventral
perception stream but do not influence motor behaviour

some motor control probably is influenced by ventral visual
stream and so is subject to illusions

e.g. grip force is related to vision: size, texture, full
etc.


Tutorial plan

sensory 8 tutorials

1: somatosens (ignore pain)

2+ vis - parallel, stereopsis

2 auditory - localisation

1 motor - reaching (next) - research exam questions +
decrees re focusing on object recognition Questions

insects are very small, yet they can still localise sounds
(microseconds temporal differentials)

integrate with vision??? layers 5+6??? kinesthesia a type of
proprioception??? motor??? can you trace from skin back to
cortex??? N

why are there waypoints (e.g. LGN???) ???

threshold hearing - ÅΩnm

(posterior parietal - dorsal visual stream)

how many human typoes of hair cells??? unimportant

serial/parallel??? why &gt;1 maps???

sII - stimulus recognition

Brodman vs Brodmann???

PNAS online

striate </code> BG???</p>

Excerpts - Johnson (2001), The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors</h5>

<p>The results support the idea that each of the four
mechanoreceptive afferent systems innervating the hand
serves a distinctly different perceptual function, and that
tactile perception can be understood as the sum of these
functions.</p>

<p>The four cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferent <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> types
that innervate the glabrous skin comprise slowly-adapting
type 1 (SA1) afferents that end in Merkel cells, rapidly
adapting (RA)afferents that end in Meissner corpuscles,
Pacinian (PC) afferents that end in PC corpuscles, and
slowly adapting type 2 (SA2) afferents that are thought to
terminate in Ruffini corpuscles. Each of these <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> types
responds to cutaneous <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and deformation in a different
way. The mechanosensitive transducers reside in the
<a href="unmyelinated.html">unmyelinated</a> endings of the afferent fibers. The receptors'
selectivity seems to be due as much to the <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a>
structure that surrounds each of these endings as to the
transducer itself.</p>

<p>The Merkel cell has the simplest structure; it is a special
cell type in the basal layer of the epidermis that enfolds
the <a href="unmyelinated.html">unmyelinated</a> ending of the SA1 afferent fiber. The SA1
<a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> is selectively sensitive to a particular component
of the local <a href="stress.html">stress</a>-strain field,which makes it sensitive to
edges, corners,and curvature;it is not known whether this
selectivity is due to the Merkel cell or to the transducer
mechanism within the afferent terminal. Meissner corpuscles
are\ relatively large cell assemblies in the dermal ridges
that lie just beneath the epidermis. They comprise cell
layers that cushion and enfold the large leaf-like endings
of two to six RA afferent fibers. This pillow-like
arrangement appears to act as a filter that protects the
velocity-sensitive endings from static skin deformation. PC
corpuscles reside in the dermis and deeper tissues. The PC
corpuscle is a large,layered onion-like structure with as
many as 70 layers,enclosing a single nerve ending that is
sensitive to deformation in the nanometer range. The layers
function as a series of mechanical filters to protect the
extremely sensitive <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> from the very large,
low-frequency stresses and strains of ordinary manual
labor. The Ruffini corpuscle, which is located in the
connective tissue of the dermis, is a relatively large
spindle shaped structure tied into the local collagen
matrix. It is, in this way, similar to the Golgi tendon
organ in <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>. Its association with connective tissue
makes it selectively sensitive to skin stretch. Each of
these <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> types and its role in perception is discussed
below.</p>

<h5><a name="sec24" id="sec24"></a>
Merkel SA1 (slowly-adapting) afferents</h5>

<p>They give us the sensation of texture(???) and curvature
when we move our fingers over an object - they have the
highest spatial resolution, aren't much affected by contact
force, and are at least 10 times more sensitive to dynamic
stimuli (at up to 80mm/s)</p>


<h5><a name="sec25" id="sec25"></a>
Meissner RA (rapidly-adapting) afferents</h5>

<p>These are even more sensitive to dynamic stimulation than
Merkel SA1s, and because they respond to stimuli over their
entire <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a>, they resolve spatial detail poorly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Johansson has shown that as we lift and manipulate an
object there are frequent microscopic slips between the
object and the skin, and that the skin <a href="motion.html">motion</a> associated
with these slips evokes reflexive increases in grip force
... A complication is that the required grip forces depend
on factors like surface coefficient of friction, as well
as the object's weight. The evidence from
microneurographic recordings in humans as they lift and
manipulate objects and controlled
psychophysical/neurophysiological experiments is that RA
afferents provide the signals that are critical for grip
control&quot;</p>
</blockquote>


<h5><a name="sec26" id="sec26"></a>
Pacinian afferents</h5>

<p>These are remarkably sensitive (sometimes responding to 10nm
of skin <a href="motion.html">motion</a>). However, they have extremely low spatial
resolution, perhaps even having the entire hand as a
receptive field. Also, they intensely filter low-frequency
stimuli that would otherwise overwhelm them. Third, they
respond to stimuli less than 100-150Hz with a phase-locked,
Poisson distribution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;The pacinian population produces a high-fidelity neural
image of transient and vibratory stimuli transmitted to
the hand by objects held in the hand. An important
consequence of this is the perception of distant events
through transmitted vibrations when we grasp an object in
the hand (Hunt). They are also responsible for perceiving
events at the working surface of a tool/probe that we are
skilled with as though our fingers were present.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RA afferents are about 2 orders of magnitude less sensitive
than pacinian corpuscles. That they pick up vibrations from
distant events was discovered by accident when spontaneous
discharges were linked to ambient vibrations in the
laboratory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;If it were not for the steep filtering provided by the
multi-layered fluid-filled corpuscles, the sensitive
<a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> within would be over-whelmed by the deformations
produced by these forces. If the extrapolation to low
frequencies illustrated in the paper is accurate, a
peak-to-peak <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of 1cm at 2Hz would not activate the
PC system.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>


<h5><a name="sec27" id="sec27"></a>
Ruffini SA2 afferents</h5>

<p>SA2 afferents innervate the skin less densely than either
SA1 or RA afferents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;SA2 <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> are about five times larger, six
times less sensitive to skin indentation but 2-4 times
more sensitive to skin stretch than SA1 afferents. The SA2
population transmits a neural image of skin stretch to the
CNS with relatively little interference from objects held
in the hand.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;They have never been observed in neurophysiological
studies of mechanoreceptors in the monkey hand, and so
have been studied less extensively than the other afferent
types.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two important roles have been identified for SA2 afferents:</p>

<ol>
<li>perception of the direction of object <a href="motion.html">motion</a>/force when
producing skin stretch (although Gardner and Sklar have
shown with vibrating pins that activate only RA and
Pacinian afferents that <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction are
still discriminated effectively without SA2 afferent
input).</li>

<li>the SA2 afferents assist (along with <a href="muscle%20spindles.html">muscle spindles</a> and
possibly <a href="joint%20afferents.html">joint afferents</a>) in the perception of hand <a href="shape.html">shape</a>
and finger position through the pattern of skin stretch
produced by each hand and finger conformation - simply
stretching this skin, activating SA2 afferents strongly
(and SA1 afferents more weakly) produces the illusion of
finger flexion, as does tendon vibration

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;The much greater sensitivity to stretch than indentation
suggests that the SA2 <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> is sensitive to horizontal
tensile strain. This and the SA2 <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a>'s deep location
seems to shield SA2 afferents from the confounding effects
of the indentation produced by an object, leaving it free
to signal the object's direction of <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and hand
conformation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>


<h5><a name="sec28" id="sec28"></a>
Conclusion</h5>

<p>There is accumulated evidence for a sharp division of
function among the four cutaneous afferent systems that
innervate the human hand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">SA1 - spatial structure of objects and surfaces that is
the basis of form and texture perception</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">RA - <a href="motion.html">motion</a> signals from the whole hand, critical for grip
control and information about the <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of objects
contacting the skin</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Pacinian - vibrations transmitted to the hand from objects
contacting or grasped in the hand (helping us to perceive
distant events through held objects)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">SA2 - skin stretch over the whole hand, possibly for hand
conformation from the dorsal SA2 image (and ventral when
the hand is empty), and ventral (when the hand is full)
for the direction of <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of objects moving across the
skin surface and about the direction of forces exerted on
the hand</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Because the computational problems inherent in processing
information for form and texture perception (SA1) have
little in common with the problems inherent in processing
information about <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction (RA and SA2
functions), the distinctively different functions
identified for the four cutaneous mechanoreceptive
afferent systems suggest the existence of distinct and
separate central systems for processing the information
provided by each of the primary afferent groups. For
example, area 3b of <a href="primary%20somatosensory%20cortex.html">primary somatosensory cortex</a> seems to
contain neurons highly selective for spatial form and to
preserve spatian information at high scanning
velocities. On the other hand, these 3b neurons are no
more sensitive to <a href="motion.html">motion</a> or <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction than are
primary afferents, suggesting that the processes
underlying <a href="motion.html">motion</a> perception lie elsewhere.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;One problem for experimenters is that all four afferent
systems are so sensitive that almost all suprathreshold
stimuli activate all four systems. In order to find out
more about the central pathways for each of the systems,
we need to learn how to more selectively stimulate the
afferent systems. Then we can understand the operations
that underlie the perceptual functions each of the
systems.&quot;</p>

sequentially, beginning at the periphery and ending in the
cortex. Peripheral damage during a perinatal period
(extending from approximately six days before birth to four
days after) alters both subcortical and cortical maps. This
has been taken as strong evidence that the action of the
periphery through thalamic afferents has a major organising
influence on the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical map. Later
peripheral damage produces local map changes without
affecting the overall boundaries.</p>

<p>Further evidence that the formation of of a
vibrissae-related pattern is extrinsic to the neocortex is
the demonstration that the visual cortex of the neonatal
rat, when transplanted to the region of the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a>
cortex, is capable of supporting ingrowth of thalamocortical
afferents, and teh expression of a vibrissae-related pattern
(Schlagger &amp; O'Leary, 1994).</p>



<h5><a name="sec30" id="sec30"></a>
Excerpts - Zhang et al. (2001), Functional characteristics of the parallel SI- and SII-projecting neurons of the thalamic ventral posterior nucleus in the marmoset - abstract only</h5>

<p>The functional organization of the primate <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a>
system at thalamocortical levels has been a matter of
controversy, in particular, over the extent to which the
primary and secondary <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical areas, SI and
SII, are organized in parallel or serial neural networks for
the processing of tactile information</p>

<p>There appeared to be no systematic differences in functional
capacities between SI- and SII-projecting neurons of each of
these three classes, based on receptive field
characteristics, on the form of stimulus-response relations,
and on measures derived from these relations. These measures
included threshold and responsiveness values, bandwidths of
vibrational sensitivity, and the capacity for responding to
cutaneous vibrotactile stimuli with phase-locked, temporally
patterned impulse activity. The analysis indicates that
low-threshold, high-acuity tactile information is conveyed
directly to both SI and SII from overlapping regions within
the thalamic VP nucleus. This direct confirmation of a
parallel functional projection to both SI and SII in the
marmoset is consistent with our separate studies at the
cortical level that demonstrate first, that tactile
responsiveness in SII largely survives the SI inactivation
and second, that SI responsiveness is largely independent of
SII. It therefore reinforces the evidence that SI and SII
occupy a hierarchically equivalent network for tactile
processing.</p>

Excerpts - Huffman &amp; Krubitzer (2001), Thalamo-cortical connections of areas 3a and M1 in marmoset monkeys</h5>

<p>In this study we examine the thalamic connections of
electrophysiologically defined regions in area 3a and
architectonically defined <a href="primary%20motor%20cortex.html">primary motor cortex</a> (M1). Our
studies demonstrate that area 3a receives input from nuclei
associated with the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> system: the superior,
inferior, and lateral divisions of the ventral posterior
complex (VPs, VPi, and VPl, respectively). Surprisingly,
area 3a receives the majority of its input from thalamic
nuclei associated with the <a href="motor%20system.html">motor system</a>, posterior division
of the ventral lateral nucleus of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> (VL), the
mediodorsal nucleus (MD), and intralaminar nuclei including
the central lateral nucleus (CL) and the center median
nucleus (CM). In addition, sparse but consistent projections
to area 3a are from the anterior <a href="pulvinar.html">pulvinar</a> (Pla). Projections
from the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> to the cortex immediately rostral to area
3a, in the architectonically defined M1, are predominantly
from VL, VA, CL, and MD. There is a conspicuous absence of
inputs from the nuclei associated with processing somatic
inputs (VP complex). Our results indicate that area 3a is
much like a motor area, in part because of its substantial
connections with <a href="motor%20nuclei.html">motor nuclei</a> of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> and motor
areas of the neocortex (Huffman et al. <sup><a name="fnr.2000" href="#fn.2000">2000</a></sup>
Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 25:1116). The indirect input from the
<a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a> and <a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a> via the ventral lateral nucleus
of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> supports its role in
<a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a>. Furthermore, the presence of input from
<a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> thalamic nuclei suggests that it plays an
important role in <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> and motor integration.</p>

<p>The somatic sensory system is concerned with four major modalities:</p>

<p><a href="discriminative%20touch.html">discriminative touch</a> (recognising the size, <a href="shape.html">shape</a> and texture of objects and their movement across the skin)</p>

<p><a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a> (the sense of static position and movement of limbs and body)</p>

<p>nociception (the signalling of tissue damage, often perceived as <a href="pain.html">pain</a>)</p>

<p>temperature sense ( warmth and cold).</p>

<p>Most aspects of touch are carried by the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system.</p>

<p>The skin and underlying tissue contain four types of receptors:</p>

<p>the superficial skin has:</p>

<p>rapidly adapting Meissner's corpuscles</p>

<p>slowly adapting Merkel's cells</p>

<p>(both respond to touch)</p>

<p>deeper tissue contains the</p>

<p>rapidly adapting pacinian corpuscles, which respond to vibrations</p>

<p>slowly adapting Ruffini's corpuscles, which respond to rapid indentation of the skin</p>

<p>These are:</p>

<p>innervated by peripheral axons of nerve cells in the <a href="dorsal%20root.html">dorsal root</a> ganglia</p>

<p>their central branches ascend in the <a href="dorsal%20columns.html">dorsal columns</a> and <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> with second-order neurons in the <a href="dorsal%20column%20nuclei.html">dorsal column nuclei</a></p>

<p>then cross the midline in the <a href="medulla.html">medulla</a> and ascend through the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stem on the contralateral side as the <a href="medial%20lemniscus.html">medial lemniscus</a></p>

<p>in the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> they <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> on third-order cells in the ventral posterior medial and ventral posterior lateral nuclei</p>

<p>the third-order neurons in the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> send axons to the primary somatic sensory cortex (S-I) in the post-central gyrus of the parietal lobe, subdivided into Brodmann's areas 1, 2, 3a and 3b</p>

<p>most thalamic fibers terminate in 3a and 3b</p>

<p>the cells in 3a and 3b project to 1 and 2</p>

<p>thalamic neurons also send a sparse projection directly to 1 and 2, and to the adjacent secondary somatic sensory cortex (S-II)</p>

<p>S-II is also innervated by neurons from each of the four areas of S-I</p>

<p>(Mishkin found that these S-I projections are required for the perceptual function of S-II, e.g. removing the neural connections in S-I representing the hand area completely prevents stimuli applied to the skin of the hand from activating neurons in S-II)</p>

<p>some thalamic neurons project to the <a href="posterior%20parietal%20cortex.html">posterior parietal cortex</a> (Brodmann's areas 5 and 7), which also receives input from S-I</p>


<p>Notes - Kaas &amp; Collins (2001), The organisation of sensory cortex
Notes - Johnson (2001), The roles and functions of cutaneous mechanoreceptors</p>

<p>The results support the idea that each of the four mechanoreceptive afferent systems innervating the hand serves a distinctly different perceptual function, and that tactile perception can be understood as the sum of these functions.</p>

<p>The four cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferent <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> types that innervate the glabrous skin comprise slowly-adapting type 1 (SA1) afferents that end in Merkel cells, rapidly adapting (RA)afferents that end in Meissner corpuscles, Pacinian (PC) afferents that end in PC corpuscles, and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2) afferents that are thought to terminate in Ruffini corpuscles. Each of these <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> types responds to cutaneous <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and deformation in a different way. The mechanosensitive transducers reside in the <a href="unmyelinated.html">unmyelinated</a> endings of the afferent fibers. The receptors' selectivity seems to be due as much to the <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> structure that surrounds each of these endings as to the transducer itself.</p>

<p>The Merkel cell has the simplest structure; it is a special cell type in the basal layer of the epidermis that enfolds the <a href="unmyelinated.html">unmyelinated</a> ending of the SA1 afferent fiber. The SA1 <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> is selectively sensitive to a particular component of the local <a href="stress.html">stress</a>-strain field,which makes it sensitive to edges, corners,and curvature;it is not known whether this selectivity is due to the Merkel cell or to the transducer mechanism within the afferent terminal. Meissner corpuscles are\ relatively large cell assemblies in the dermal ridges that lie just beneath the epidermis. They comprise cell layers that cushion and enfold the large leaf-like endings of two to six RA afferent fibers. This pillow-like arrangement appears to act as a filter that protects the velocity-sensitive endings from static skin deformation. PC corpuscles reside in the dermis and deeper tissues. The PC corpuscle is a large,layered onion-like structure with as many as 70 layers,enclosing a single nerve ending that is sensitive to deformation in the nanometer range. The layers function as a series of mechanical filters to protect the extremely sensitive <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> from the very large, low-frequency stresses and strains of ordinary manual labor. The Ruffini corpuscle, which is located in the connective tissue of the dermis, is a relatively large spindle shaped structure tied into the local collagen matrix. It is, in this way, similar to the Golgi tendon organ in <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>. Its association with connective tissue makes it selectively sensitive to skin stretch. Each of these <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> types and its role in perception is discussed below.
Merkel SA1 (slowly-adapting) afferents</p>

<p>They give us the sensation of texture(???) and curvature when we move our fingers over an object - they have the highest spatial resolution, aren't much affected by contact force, and are at least 10 times more sensitive to dynamic stimuli (at up to 80mm/s)
Meissner RA (rapidly-adapting) afferents</p>

<p>These are even more sensitive to dynamic stimulation than Merkel SA1s, and because they respond to stimuli over their entire <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a>, they resolve spatial detail poorly.</p>

<p>Johansson has shown that as we lift and manipulate an object there are frequent microscopic slips between the object and the skin, and that the skin <a href="motion.html">motion</a> associated with these slips evokes reflexive increases in grip force í°ƒ A complication is that the required grip forces depend on factors like surface coefficient of friction, as well as the object's weight. The evidence from microneurographic recordings in humans as they lift and manipulate objects and controlled psychophysical/neurophysiological experiments is that RA afferents provide the signals that are critical for grip control
Pacinian afferents</p>

<p>These are remarkably sensitive (sometimes responding to 10nm of skin <a href="motion.html">motion</a>). However, they have extremely low spatial resolution, perhaps even having the entire hand as a receptive field. Also, they intensely filter low-frequency stimuli that would otherwise overwhelm them. Third, they respond to stimuli less than 100-150Hz with a phase-locked, Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>The pacinian population produces a high-fidelity neural image of transient and vibratory stimuli transmitted to the hand by objects held in the hand. An important consequence of this is the perception of distant events through transmitted vibrations when we grasp an object in the hand (Hunt). They are also responsible for perceiving events at the working surface of a tool/probe that we are skilled with as though our fingers were present.</p>

<p>RA afferents are about 2 orders of magnitude less sensitive than pacinian corpuscles. That they pick up vibrations from distant events was discovered by accident when spontaneous discharges were linked to ambient vibrations in the laboratory.</p>

<p>If it were not for the steep filtering provided by the multi-layered fluid-filled corpuscles, the sensitive <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> within would be over-whelmed by the deformations produced by these forces. If the extrapolation to low frequencies illustrated in the paper is accurate, a peak-to-peak <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of 1cm at 2Hz would not activate the PC system.
Ruffini SA2 afferents</p>

<p>SA2 afferents innervate the skin less densely than either SA1 or RA afferents.</p>

<p>SA2 <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> are about five times larger, six times less sensitive to skin indentation but 2-4 times more sensitive to skin stretch than SA1 afferents. The SA2 population transmits a neural image of skin stretch to the CNS with relatively little interference from objects held in the hand.</p>

<p>They have never been observed in neurophysiological studies of mechanoreceptors in the monkey hand, and so have been studied less extensively than the other afferent types.</p>

<p>Two important roles have been identified for SA2 afferents:</p>

<p>1.     perception of the direction of object <a href="motion.html">motion</a>/force when producing skin stretch (although Gardner and Sklar have shown with vibrating pins that activate only RA and Pacinian afferents that <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction are still discriminated effectively without SA2 afferent input).</p>

<p>2.     the SA2 afferents assist (along with <a href="muscle%20spindles.html">muscle spindles</a> and possibly <a href="joint%20afferents.html">joint afferents</a>) in the perception of hand <a href="shape.html">shape</a> and finger position through the pattern of skin stretch produced by each hand and finger conformation - simply stretching this skin, activating SA2 afferents strongly (and SA1 afferents more weakly) produces the illusion of finger flexion, as does tendon vibration</p>

<p>The much greater sensitivity to stretch than indentation suggests that the SA2 <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> is sensitive to horizontal tensile strain. This and the SA2 <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a>'s deep location seems to shield SA2 afferents from the confounding effects of the indentation produced by an object, leaving it free to signal the object's direction of <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and hand conformation.
Conclusion</p>

<p>There is accumulated evidence for a sharp division of function among the four cutaneous afferent systems that innervate the human hand:</p>

<p>SA1 - spatial structure of objects and surfaces that is the basis of form and texture perception</p>

<p>RA - <a href="motion.html">motion</a> signals from the whole hand, critical for grip control and information about the <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of objects contacting the skin</p>

<p>Pacinian - vibrations transmitted to the hand from objects contacting or grasped in the hand (helping us to perceive distant events through held objects)</p>

<p>SA2 - skin stretch over the whole hand, possibly for hand conformation from the dorsal SA2 image (and ventral when the hand is empty), and ventral (when the hand is full) for the direction of <a href="motion.html">motion</a> of objects moving across the skin surface and about the direction of forces exerted on the hand</p>

<p>Because the computational problems inherent in processing information for form and texture perception (SA1) have little in common with the problems inherent in processing information about <a href="motion.html">motion</a> and <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction (RA and SA2 functions), the distinctively different functions identified for the four cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferent systems suggest the existence of distinct and separate central systems for processing the information provided by each of the primary afferent groups. For example, area 3b of <a href="primary%20somatosensory%20cortex.html">primary somatosensory cortex</a> seems to contain neurons highly selective for spatial form and to preserve spatian information at high scanning velocities. On the other hand, these 3b neurons are no more sensitive to <a href="motion.html">motion</a> or <a href="motion.html">motion</a> direction than are primary afferents, suggesting that the processes underlying <a href="motion.html">motion</a> perception lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>One problem for experimenters is that all four afferent systems are so sensitive that almost all suprathreshold stimuli activate all four systems. In order to find out more about the central pathways for each of the systems, we need to learn how to more selectively stimulate the afferent systems. Then we can understand the operations that underlie the perceptual functions each of the systems.

Notes - Killackey (1995), The formation of a cortical somatotopic map (in rodents)</p>

<p>The <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical map in the rat has been demonstrated by a number of anatomical techniques, including the Nissl stain, histochemistory of succinic dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase and AChE and immunocytochemistory of 5-HT</p>

<p>The distribution of thalamocortical afferent terminals arising in the ventral posterior nucleus forms this same map</p>

<p>During development, the subcortical and cortical maps emerge sequentially, beginning at the periphery and ending in the cortex. Peripheral damage during a perinatal period (extending from approximately six days before birth to four days after) alters both subcortical and cortical maps. This has been taken as strong evidence that the action of the periphery through thalamic afferents has a major organising influence on the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical map. Later peripheral damage produces local map changes without affecting the overall boundaries.</p>

<p>Further evidence that the formation of of a vibrissae-related pattern is extrinsic to the neocortex is the demonstration that the visual cortex of the neonatal rat, when transplanted to the region of the <a href="somatosensory%20cortex.html">somatosensory cortex</a>, is capable of supporting ingrowth of thalamocortical afferents, and teh expression of a vibrissae-related pattern (Schlagger &amp; O'Leary, 1994).
Notes - Zhang et al. (2001), Functional characteristics of the parallel SI- and SII-projecting neurons of the thalamic ventral posterior nucleus in the marmoset - abstract only</p>

<p>The functional organization of the primate <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> system at thalamocortical levels has been a matter of controversy, in particular, over the extent to which the primary and secondary <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical areas, SI and SII, are organized in parallel or serial neural networks for the processing of tactile information</p>

<p>There appeared to be no systematic differences in functional capacities between SI- and SII-projecting neurons of each of these three classes, based on receptive field characteristics, on the form of stimulus-response relations, and on measures derived from these relations. These measures included threshold and responsiveness values, bandwidths of vibrational sensitivity, and the capacity for responding to cutaneous vibrotactile stimuli with phase-locked, temporally patterned impulse activity. The analysis indicates that low-threshold, high-acuity tactile information is conveyed directly to both SI and SII from overlapping regions within the thalamic VP nucleus. This direct confirmation of a parallel functional projection to both SI and SII in the marmoset is consistent with our separate studies at the cortical level that demonstrate first, that tactile responsiveness in SII largely survives the SI inactivation and second, that SI responsiveness is largely independent of SII. It therefore reinforces the evidence that SI and SII occupy a hierarchically equivalent network for tactile processing.
Notes - Huffman &amp; Krubitzer (2001), Thalamo-cortical connections of areas 3a and M1 in marmoset monkeys</p>

<p>In this study we examine the thalamic connections of electrophysiologically defined regions in area 3a and architectonically defined <a href="primary%20motor%20cortex.html">primary motor cortex</a> (M1). Our studies demonstrate that area 3a receives input from nuclei associated with the <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> system:  the superior, inferior, and lateral divisions of the ventral posterior complex (VPs, VPi, and VPl, respectively). Surprisingly, area 3a receives the majority of its input from thalamic nuclei associated with the <a href="motor%20system.html">motor system</a>, posterior division of the ventral lateral nucleus of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> (VL), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD), and intralaminar nuclei including the central lateral nucleus (CL) and the centre median nucleus (CM). In addition, sparse but consistent projections to area 3a are from the anterior <a href="pulvinar.html">pulvinar</a> (Pla). Projections from the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> to the cortex immediately rostral to area 3a, in the architectonically defined M1, are predominantly from VL, VA, CL, and MD. There is a conspicuous absence of inputs from the nuclei associated with processing somatic inputs (VP complex). Our results indicate that area 3a is much like a motor area, in part because of its substantial connections with <a href="motor%20nuclei.html">motor nuclei</a> of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> and motor areas of the neocortex (Huffman et al. <sup><a name="fnr.2000" href="#fn.2000">2000</a></sup> Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 25:1116). The indirect input from the <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a> and <a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a> via the ventral lateral nucleus of the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> supports its role in <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a>. Furthermore, the presence of input from <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> thalamic nuclei suggests that it plays an important role in <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> and motor integration.
