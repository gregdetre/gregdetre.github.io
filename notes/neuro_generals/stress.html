<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">When a body is in homeostatic balance, various
measures&mdash;such as temperature, glucose level and so
on&mdash;are as close to &quot;ideal&quot; as possible. A stressor is
anything in the environment that knocks the body out of
homeostasis, and the <a href="stress%20response.html">stress response</a> is the array of
physiological adaptations that ultimately reestablishes
balance. The response principally includes the secretion
of two types of hormones from the adrenal glands:
epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, and
<a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a>. In humans, the relevant glucocorticoid is
called <a href="cortisol.html">cortisol</a>, also known as hydrocortisone.</p>

<p class="quoted">For its part, anxiety seems to wreak havoc in the limbic
system, the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> region concerned with <a href="emotion.html">emotion</a>. One
structure is primarily affected: the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>, which is
involved in the perception of and response to fear-evoking
stimuli. (Interestingly, the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> is also central to
<a href="aggression.html">aggression</a>, underlining the fact that <a href="aggression.html">aggression</a> can be
rooted in fear&mdash;an observation that can explain much
sociopolitical behavior.)</p>

<p class="quoted"><a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> gets input from cortex and subcortical</p>

<p class="quoted">The <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>, in turn, contacts an array of <a href="brain.html">brain</a> regions,
making heavy use of a <a href="neurotransmitter.html">neurotransmitter</a> called
corticotropin-releasing <a href="hormone.html">hormone</a> (<a href="CRH.html">CRH</a>). One set of nerve
cells projecting from the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> reaches evolutionarily
ancient parts of the <a href="midbrain.html">midbrain</a> and <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stem. These
structures control the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system.html">autonomic nervous system</a>, the
network of nerve cells projecting to parts of the body
over which you normally have no conscious control (your
heart, for example). One half of the autonomic nervous
system is the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system.html">sympathetic nervous system</a>, which mediates
&quot;fight or flight.&quot; Activate your <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> with a threat,
and soon the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system.html">sympathetic nervous system</a> has directed your

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Moreover, the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> sends projections to the sensory
cortices as well, which may explain, in part, why
sensations seem so vivid when we are in certain emotional

in victims of trauma.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Joseph <a href="LeDoux.html">LeDoux</a> of New York University has shown that
repeatedly placing rats in a fear-provoking situation can
bring about <a href="LTP.html">LTP</a> in the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. Work by Sumantra
Chattarji of the National Center for Biological Science in
Bangalore extends this finding one remarkable step
further: the amygdalic neurons of rats in stressful
situations sprout new branches, allowing them to make more
connections with other neurons. As a result, any part of
the fear-inducing situation could end up triggering more
firing between neurons in the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">As will become quite pertinent when we turn to <a href="depression.html">depression</a>,
glucocorticoid exposure can impair <a href="LTP.html">LTP</a> in the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>
and can even cause atrophy of neurons there. This
phenomenon constitutes the opposite of the <a href="stress%20response.html">stress response</a>
in the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. Severe <a href="stress.html">stress</a> can harm the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>,
preventing the consolidation of a conscious, explicit
<a href="memory.html">memory</a> of the event; at the same time, new neuronal
branches and enhanced <a href="LTP.html">LTP</a> facilitate the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>'s
<a href="implicit%20memory.html">implicit memory</a> machinery. In subsequent situations, the
<a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> might respond to preconscious information&mdash;but
conscious awareness or <a href="memory.html">memory</a> may never follow. According
to <a href="LeDoux.html">LeDoux</a>, such a mechanism could underlie forms of
free-floating anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">It is interesting that these structural changes come
about, in part, because of hormones secreted by the
adrenal glands, a source well outside the <a href="brain.html">brain</a>. As
mentioned, the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>'s perception of <a href="stress.html">stress</a> ultimately
leads to the secretion of epinephrine and
<a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a>. The <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> then activate a <a href="brain.html">brain</a>
region called the locus coeruleus. This structure, in
turn, sends a powerfully activating projection back to the
<a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>, making use of a <a href="neurotransmitter.html">neurotransmitter</a> called
<a href="norepinephrine.html">norepinephrine</a> (a close relative of epinephrine). The
<a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> then sends out more <a href="CRH.html">CRH</a>, which leads to the
secretion of more <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a>. A vicious circle of
mind-body feedback can result.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The medicines that already exist do target aspects of the
<a href="stress.html">stress</a> system. The minor tranquilizers, such as Valium and
Librium, are in a class of compounds called
benzodiazepines. They work in part by relaxing muscles;
they also inhibit the <a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> projection from the locus
coeruleus into the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>, thereby decreasing the
likelihood that the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> will mobilize the sympathetic
nervous system. The net result is a calm body&mdash;and a less
anxious body means a less anxious <a href="brain.html">brain</a>. While effective,
however, benzodiazepines are also sedating and addictive,
and considerable research now focuses on finding less
troublesome versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In their search for alternatives, researchers have sought
to target the <a href="stress%20response.html">stress response</a> upstream of the locus
coeruleus and <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. Epinephrine activates a nerve
called the vagus, which projects into a <a href="brain.html">brain</a> region that
subsequently stimulates the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. A new therapy
curtails epinephrine's stimulation of the <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">where does the <a href="vagus%20nerve.html">vagus nerve</a> project into???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Drugs called beta blockers fit into some kinds of
epinephrine receptors, preventing real epinephrine from
transmitting any information. Beta blockers have long been
used to reduce high blood pressure driven by an overactive
<a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system.html">sympathetic nervous system</a>, as well as to reduce stage
fright. But Larry Cahill and James <a href="McGaugh.html">McGaugh</a> of the
University of California at Irvine have shown that the
drugs also blunt the formation of memories of emotionally
disturbing events or stories. Based on their findings and
others, clinicians such as Roger Pitman of Harvard
University have started studies in which beta blockers are
given to people who have experienced severe trauma in the
hope of heading off the development of post-traumatic
<a href="stress.html">stress</a> disorder.</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">In contrast to anxiety, which can feel like desperate
hyperactivity, major <a href="depression.html">depression</a> is characterized by
helplessness, despair, an exhausted sense of being too
overwhelmed to do anything (psychomotor retardation) and a
loss of feelings of pleasure. Accordingly, <a href="depression.html">depression</a> has
a different biology and requires some different strategies
for treatment. But it, too, can be related to <a href="stress.html">stress</a>, and
there is ample evidence of this association. First of all,
psychological <a href="stress.html">stress</a> entails feeling a loss of control and
predictability&mdash;an accurate description of
<a href="depression.html">depression</a>. Second, major stressful events seem to precede
depressive episodes early in the course of the
disease. Finally, treating people with glucocorticoid
hormones to control conditions such as rheumatoid
arthritis can lead to <a href="depression.html">depression</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">One way in which <a href="stress.html">stress</a> brings about <a href="depression.html">depression</a> is by
acting on the <a href="brain.html">brain</a>'s mood and pleasure pathways. To
begin, prolonged exposure to glucocorticoid hormones
depletes <a href="norepinephrine.html">norepinephrine</a> levels in the locus coeruleus
neurons. Most plausibly, this means that the animal&mdash;or
person&mdash;becomes less attentive, less vigilant, less
active: psychomotor retardation sets in.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Continued <a href="stress.html">stress</a> also decreases levels of <a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a>&mdash;which
may be important in the regulation of mood and <a href="sleep.html">sleep</a>
cycles, among other things&mdash;as well as the number of
<a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a> receptors in the <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>. Serotonin
normally arrives in the <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a> by way of the raphe
nucleus, a structure that also communicates with the locus
coeruleus. You can probably see where this is
going. Normally, <a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a> stimulates the release of
<a href="norepinephrine.html">norepinephrine</a> from the locus coeruleus. When <a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a>
becomes scarce, less <a href="norepinephrine.html">norepinephrine</a> is
released&mdash;exacerbating the shortage caused by earlier
unremitting glucocorticoid bombardment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Stress affects <a href="dopamine.html">dopamine</a>, the main currency of the pleasure
pathway, in a way that seems counterintuitive at
first. Moderate and transient amounts of <a href="stress.html">stress</a>&mdash;and the
ensuing presence of <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a>&mdash;increase <a href="dopamine.html">dopamine</a>
release in the pleasure pathway, which runs between a
region called the ventral tegmentum/<a href="nucleus%20accumbens.html">nucleus accumbens</a> and
the <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>. More <a href="dopamine.html">dopamine</a> can lead to a feeling of
well-being in situations of moderate or transient <a href="stress.html">stress</a>
during which a subject is challenged briefly and not too
severely. For a human, or a rat, this situation would
entail a task that is not trivial, but one in which there
is, nonetheless, a reasonably high likelihood of
success&mdash;in other words, what we generally call
&quot;stimulation.&quot; But with chronic glucocorticoid exposure,
<a href="dopamine.html">dopamine</a> production is curbed and the feelings of pleasure
fade.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Not surprisingly, the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> also appears relevant to
<a href="depression.html">depression</a>. Wayne Drevets of the National Institute of
Mental Health reports that the images of the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> of a
depressed person light up more in response to sad faces
than angry ones. Moreover, the enhanced autonomic arousal
seen in anxiety&mdash;thought to be driven by the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>&mdash;is
often observed in <a href="depression.html">depression</a> as well. This fact might seem
puzzling at first: anxiety is characterized by a skittish
torrent of fight-or-flight signals, whereas <a href="depression.html">depression</a>
seems to be about torpor. Yet the helplessness of
<a href="depression.html">depression</a> is not a quiet, passive state. The dread is
active, twitching, energy-consuming, distracting,
exhausting&mdash;but internalized. A classic conceptualization
of <a href="depression.html">depression</a> is that it represents <a href="aggression.html">aggression</a> turned
inward&mdash;an enormous emotional battle fought entirely
internally&mdash;and the disease's physiology supports this
analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Stress also acts on the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>, and this activity may
bring about some of the hallmarks of <a href="depression.html">depression</a>:
difficulty <a href="learning.html">learning</a> and remembering. As I explained
before, <a href="stress.html">stress</a> and <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> can disrupt <a href="memory.html">memory</a>
formation in the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> and can cause hippocampal
neurons to atrophy and lose some of their many
branches. In the 1980s several laboratories, including my
own, showed that <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> can kill hippocampal
neurons or impair their ability to survive neurological
insults such as a seizure or cardiac arrest.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Stress can even prevent the growth of new nerve
cells. .... And although some findings
remain controversial, it is clear that new neurons form in
the olfactory bulb and the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> of many adult
animals, including humans. Many
things, including <a href="learning.html">learning</a>, <a href="exercise.html">exercise</a> and environmental
enrichment, stimulate <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a> in the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>. But
<a href="stress.html">stress</a> and <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> inhibit it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">As would be expected, <a href="depression.html">depression</a> is associated with
impaired declarative <a href="memory.html">memory</a>. This impairment extends
beyond remembering the details of an acute trauma. Instead
<a href="depression.html">depression</a> can interfere with declarative <a href="memory.html">memory</a> formation
in general&mdash;in people going about their everyday routine
or working or <a href="learning.html">learning</a>. Recent and startling medical
literature shows that in those who have been seriously
depressed for years, the volume of the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> is 10
to 20 percent smaller than in well-matched control
subjects. There is little evidence that a small
<a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> predisposes someone toward <a href="depression.html">depression</a>; rather
the decreased volume appears to be a loss in response to
<a href="depression.html">depression</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Glucocorticoids may act on the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> by inhibiting
levels of a compound called <a href="brain.html">brain</a>-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF)&mdash;which may aid <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a>. Several known
antidepressants increase amounts of BDNF and stimulate
hippocampal <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a> in laboratory animals. These
findings have led some scientists to speculate that the
<a href="stress.html">stress</a>-induced inhibition of <a href="neurogenesis.html">neurogenesis</a> and of BDNF are
central to the emotional symptoms of <a href="depression.html">depression</a>. I find it
to be somewhat of a stretch to connect altered hippocampal
function with the many facets of this
disease. Nevertheless, these hippocampal changes may play
a large part in the substantial <a href="memory.html">memory</a> dysfunction typical
of major <a href="depression.html">depression</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The <a href="current.html">current</a> generation of antidepressants boost levels of
<a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a>, <a href="dopamine.html">dopamine</a> and <a href="norepinephrine.html">norepinephrine</a>, and there is
tremendous ongoing research to develop more effective
versions of these drugs. But some novel therapies target
steps more intimately related to the interactions between
<a href="stress.html">stress</a> and <a href="depression.html">depression</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Not surprisingly, some of that work focuses on the effects
of <a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a>. For example, a number of
pharmaceuticals that are safe and clinically approved for
other reasons can transiently block the synthesis of
<a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> in the adrenal glands or block access of
<a href="glucocorticoids.html">glucocorticoids</a> to one of their important receptors in the
<a href="brain.html">brain</a>. Fascinatingly, the key compound that blocks
glucocorticoid receptors is RU486, famous and
controversial for its capacity to also block progesterone
receptors in the uterus and for its use as the &quot;abortion
drug.&quot; Beverly Murphy of <a href="McGill.html">McGill</a> University, Owen Wolkowitz
of the University of California at San Francisco and Alan
Schatzberg of Stanford have shown that such
antiglucocorticoids can act as antidepressants for a
subset of severely depressed people with highly elevated
glucocorticoid levels. These findings are made even more
promising by the fact that this group of depressed
individuals tend to be most resistant to the effects of
more traditional antidepressants.</p>
