<p>Somatosensory</p>

<p>dermatomes - regions projecting to each dorsal root</p>

<p>Pacinian corpuscle, Meissnerí°«s corpuscle, Merkelí°«s discs, Ruffini endings</p>

<p>glabrous = hairless</p>

<p>free/naked endings = hairy skin, hair follicles, glabrous skin, deep fascia/visceral organs</p>

<p>small/unmyelinated fibres C + Ad (III + IV, II)</p>

<p>encapsulated endings</p>

<p>Ab (II)</p>



<p>í°ƒ hair</p>

<p>base - Pacinian corpuscles (pressure-sensitive)</p>

<p>middle - Merkelí°«s discs</p>

<p>length - <a href="thin%20filaments.html">thin filaments</a> link to palisade of fast-adapting endings)</p>



<p>free endings - warmth + pain (+ possibly mechanical stimulation too)</p>

<p>encapsulated endings - some for cold</p>

<p>others - mechanoreceptors of some kind</p>



<p>concentric layers of Pacinian corpuscle - complete + rapid adapter</p>

<p>non-directional sensitivity to local deformation - pressure</p>



<p>Ruffini organs - branched naked nerve endings twisted between collagen fibres that leave the capsule and anchored to nearby cells/other structures</p>

<p>simtulated by tension which distorts the nerve endings</p>

<p>adapt incompletely</p>

<p>similar to Golgi tendon organs (<a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a>)</p>



<p>Merkelí°«s discs - close to the outside</p>

<p>attached by dermosomes to the bottom of the epidermis</p>

<p>very sensitive to deformation of the skin</p>

<p>incomplete adaptation</p>

<p>light touch receptors - contact</p>



<p>Meissnerí°«s corpuscles</p>

<p>nerve endings associated with collagen fibres</p>

<p>found in the dermal folds beneath the epidermal ridges</p>

<p>collagen fibres are connected sideways with the epidermal cells</p>

<p>register sideways shearing of the shin (especially/e.g. lifting an object, in the fingertips)</p>

<p>density ÅØÅØ with age (from 50/sq mm ÅÆ 10/sq mm)</p>



<p>because many of these receptors are completely adapting - only perceive much when the pattern of stimulation changes</p>

<p>feeling of touch = temporal patterns of firing of mechanoreceptors in the skin, with knowledge of the movements made</p>



<p>2 types of afferent fibres</p>

<p>small - mostly from free endings</p>

<p>large - mostly encapsulated endings</p>

<p>different modes of termination in the nervous system</p>

<p>different parts of the dorsal horn of the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a></p>



<p>dorsal horn divides into 6 (c. parallel) laminae</p>



<p>smaller fibres enter directly from the dorsal root</p>

<p>ÅÆ terminate  in I + II</p>

<p>largest fibres ÅÆ III-IV</p>

<p>make contact with cells including short inter-neurons ÅÆ II</p>

<p>(important in processing pain signals)</p>

<p>neurons in the dorsal horn = control by <a href="brain.html">brain</a></p>

<p>if the descending pathways are blocked</p>

<p>Åﬁ radically alters the <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> of the dorsal horn cells</p>


<p>Central projections</p>

<p>1.     branches of the larger fibres (from encapsulated mechanoreceptors)</p>

<p>ÅÆ turn upwards after entering the dorsal horn</p>

<p>form: pair of large ascending dorsal columns</p>

<p>ÅÆ ipsilaterally up to the <a href="medulla.html">medulla</a></p>

<p>terminate in the dorsal column nuclei (gracile + cuneate)</p>

<p>gracile: inputs from sacral, lumbar and lower thoracic</p>

<p>cuneate: inputs from higher regions</p>

<p>then 2nd-order fibres ÅÆ contralaterally    realy through the <a href="internal%20capsule.html">internal capsule</a> ÅÆ <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> cortical area</p>

<p>(SI = areas 3, 2, 1)</p>

<p>lemniscal system - preserves general topographic relationship between different areas of the skin</p>

<p>sensory homunculus - neighbouring, but distorted <a href="shape.html">shape</a></p>

<p>SII - receives <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> information from both sides</p>

<p>responds to different modalities from SI</p>



<p>2.     smaller afferents (free endings + some encapsulated ones)</p>

<p>temperature, pain + light touch</p>

<p>ÅÆ neurons in I + V, then ascend contra-laterally as spino-thalamic projection</p>

<p>anterior + lateral spinothalamic pathways = anterolateral system</p>

<p>= older than the lemniscal system</p>



<p>new, fast lemniscal system - precise + orderly projection directly ÅÆ cortex</p>

<p>older, slower/diffuse projection anterolateral system - often less precise but immediately important information (often with emotional/affective quality)</p>

<p>one gives objective information, the other requires a response</p>



<p>hemisection of the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> that cuts of all ascending fibres on one side below that level</p>

<p>loss of deep pressure + vibration on one side</p>

<p>loss of pain, temperature and light touch on the other</p>



<p>also: cutaneous fibres ascend in the posterior spinocerebellar tract</p>


<p>Neural responses</p>

<p>larger Ab (group II) fibres from the skin = respond to mechanical stimuli</p>

<p>completely adapting (e.g. Pacinian + Meissner, + some endings in hair follicles) - only respond to changes in the skin</p>

<p>very sensitive to vibration</p>

<p>Åﬁ sense of roughness when hand passes over textured surface</p>

<p>very sensitive - threshold of Pacinian = 10mm/nm??? of skin displacement (if rapidly applied)</p>

<p>help with <a href="grasping.html">grasping</a> + when objects slip (if fingers anaesthetised, don't modify grip for slippery objects) - short latency</p>



<p>incomplete adaptation - signal static deformation too</p>

<p>Merkelí°«s discs + Ruffini endings</p>

<p>e.g. micro-electrode recording - microstimulation of a single AP in the fast-adapting fibres Åﬁ sensation</p>

<p>smaller Ad + C cutaneous afferent fibres - light touch, pain and temperature more complex patterns</p>

<p>warm + cold Ad fibres: fire tonically as a function of temperature</p>

<p>peak for     warm fibres: 45Å∞ C</p>

<center>
<p>cold fibres: 30Å∞ C</p>
</center>

<p>incomplete adaptation - sudden warming skin Åﬁ transient discharge whose activity settles at a new level (same with sudden cooling)</p>



<p>paradoxical cold - cold receptors also respond to warming &gt;45Å∞C</p>

<p>adaptation of these receptors ÅÆ perception of skin temperature</p>



<p>thermoreceptors: very small <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a></p>

<p>separated, not overlapping: warm/cold spots 5-15mm apart</p>

<p>very few fibres ascend in spinothalamic tract (c. 1000)</p>

<p>don't need acute spatial resolution</p>


<p>Receptive fields</p>

<p>RF = the particular area (of skin) within which a stimulus will affect the firing of a particular fibre</p>

<p>one fibre ÅÆ 100 hair follicles, each innervated by &gt;1 fibres</p>

<p>the <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> are very large, with overlap</p>

<p>overlapping <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> Åﬁ Å≠ accuracy of localisation and less vulnerable to damage</p>


<p>Lateral inhibition</p>

<p>at 2nd order level where the incoming afferent fibres are relaying ÅÆ ascending 2nd-order fibres (gracile + cuneate nuclei)</p>

<p>excite inter-neurons too which send <a href="inhibitory.html">inhibitory</a> connections to neighbouring 2nd-order cells</p>

<p>each incoming fibre stimulates its own 2nd order cell but inhibits the surrounding ones</p>

<p>the cells are pushing on each otherí°«s shoulders</p>



<p>lateral inhibition - exaggerates changes in intensity</p>

<p>compensates for the blurring from the overlap of the <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a></p>

<p>or whenever there is con/divergence in the projection from one neuronal level to another</p>



<p>enhances edges - neural activity maximum around the border</p>

<p>i.e. adaptation in the spatial, not temporal, domain</p>

<p>e.g. hottest at the surface of hot water around your leg</p>

<p>ÅØ redundancy of neural signals</p>



<p>does not Å≠ acuity (= spatial detail)</p>

<p>2-point discrimination test - variation depends on the size of the <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a></p>

<p>can't tell if one point or two, but can tell when one goes</p>


<p>Central responses</p>

<p>SI: large-scale sensory homunculus organisation</p>

<p>mosaic of columns &lt;1mm in diameter</p>

<p>responses of cells at any <a href="depth.html">depth</a> within a column = particular modality and localised areas of skin</p>

<p>neighbouring columns: different modality, similar location</p>

<p>mutually <a href="inhibitory.html">inhibitory</a></p>

<p>differences between areas 1, 2, 3 - classic modalities, deep vs superficial receptors</p>

<p>the maps = very dynamic + flexible</p>

<p>bandaging a monkeyí°«s hand Åﬁ different cortical map in hours</p>

<p>amputation/severing peripheral nerves Åﬁ lose cortical representation completely</p>



<p>SII - more complex analysis of afferent information</p>

<p>bi-lateral activated      <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a> for opposite sides of the body - mirror images</p>

<p>outlying     direction-specific responses</p>

<p>respond to &gt;1 stimulus modality</p>

<p>painful stimuli</p>

<p>electrical stimulation Åﬁ tingling í°∆electricí°« sensations</p>

<p>lesions Åﬁ raised tactile thresholds</p>

<p>ÅØ 2-point discrimination</p>

<p>impairment in finer <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> judgements</p>

<p>post-parietal regions: putting things together</p>

<p>e.g. <a href="shape.html">shape</a> of hand-held objects = astereognosis</p>

<p>primary somatic sens - relatively unimpaired</p>


<p>Pain</p>

<p>pricking vs burning pain          Ad + C fibres</p>

<p>experiments on humans - peripheral nerve conduction blocked</p>

<p>(by <a href="anoxia.html">anoxia</a> or local anaesthetics)</p>

<p><a href="anoxia.html">anoxia</a> - by inflating a cuff round the arm - affects the largest fibres first, then the C fibres</p>

<p>lose pressure and position sense first</p>

<p>then (Ad) temperature sense and pricking pain</p>

<p>then burning pain and itch</p>



<p>local anaesthetics</p>

<p>C fibres go first - burning pain + itch</p>

<p>largest A fibres last - temperature and pricking sense, then pressure</p>



<p>recordings from single afferents</p>

<p>Ad: very sensitive to mechanical deformation of the skin</p>

<p>large <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a>, pain spots</p>

<p>C: various types</p>

<p>some respond to mechanical stimulation</p>

<p>others respond specifically to extreme cold/heat</p>



<p>both C + Ad fibres = free endings in the skin</p>



<p>2 different kinds of response/function to pain</p>

<p>withdrawal, e.g. when touching a hot object</p>

<p>rapid response + fast fibres</p>

<p>immobilisation - protecting the affected part from further injury through movement, e.g. back injury</p>

<p>long-term response; slow fibres sufficient</p>

<p>visceral pain = C-fibres only</p>

<p>also: hence warm + cold receptors, not just a single temperature <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a></p>



<p>stimluation of the viscera ÅÆ pain</p>

<p>especially severe distension/constriction</p>

<p>yet the digestive tract - insensitive to cutting/burning/chem</p>

<p>often referred ÅÆ body surface sharing the dorsal root</p>

<p>left arm &lt;= angina pectoris</p>

<p>groin &lt;= stone in ureter</p>



<p>itch - C fibres (blockign experiments)</p>

<p>tickle - represents the sensation produced by particular pattern of stimulation of the C fibres</p>

<p>(perhaps = the result of release of <a href="histamine.html">histamine</a> from damaged tissue)</p>

<p>both demand a response - like all C-fibre stimuli</p>



<p>central pathways for pain</p>

<p>anterolateral system</p>

<p>sectioning Åﬁ complete peripheral analgesia (pricking + burning)</p>

<p>at higher levels: the two types of pain have slightly different distributions</p>

<p>ascending pricking pain fibres ÅÆ <a href="somatosensory.html">somatosensory</a> <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> then ÅÆ cortex (especially SII)</p>

<p>burning: older + more diffuse</p>

<p>central thalamic regions: general projections ÅÆ the cortex, the ascending <a href="reticular%20formation.html">reticular formation</a>, periaqueductal grey and <a href="hypothalamus.html">hypothalamus</a></p>

<p>interferences with the <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> in humans Åﬁ greater effect than cortex</p>



<p>electrical stimulation of:</p>

<p>ventrobasal region Åﬁ pricking pain</p>

<p>central regions Åﬁ intense unpleasantness</p>



<p>lesions of <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> Åﬁ relief from chronic pain or unendurable spontaneous pain</p>

<p>cortex:</p>

<p>damage: sometimes slightly ÅØ pain</p>

<p>stimulation: doesn't Åﬁ pain sensations</p>



<p>relationship between type/intensity of stimulus and pain felt is very variable</p>

<p>depends largely on emotional state, + implications of the pain</p>

<p>excited/unexpected: feel little pain</p>

<p>apprehensive, e.g. dentist - very violent reaction to any stimulus</p>



<p>pain ë°÷ <a href="emotion.html">emotion</a> triggered by certain patterns of cutaneous stimulation</p>

<p>difference between objective sense of the existence of noxious stimulus vs í°∆feelingí°« the pain</p>

<p>(see frontal leucotomy for intractable pain)</p>



<p>pain: influenced a lot by other modes of skin stimulation</p>

<p>ÅØ by warmth, mechanical stimulation, rubbing, acupuncture, self-stimulation with implanted electrodes</p>

<p>Å≠ by specific damage to larger cutaneous afferents</p>

<p>Åﬁ Å≠ sensitivity to painful stimuli</p>



<p>Melzack and Wall: 1962 explanation for this antagonism between larger cutaneous afferents and smaller pain fibres</p>

<p>inter-neurons in the substantia gelatinosa (dorsal horn layers I + II) receive <a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> information from incoming large mechanical fibres</p>

<p>Åﬁ inhibit the neurons of the ascending anterolateral system</p>

<p>\ the response to a nociceptive stimulus Åµ balance between stimulation of large/small fibres</p>

<p>= a gating mechanism</p>

<p>WDR cells (wide dynamic range) in the anterolateral system</p>

<p>concentric receptive field</p>

<p>centre: light touch + noxious</p>

<p>surround: inhibited by mechanical stimulation</p>

<p>\ large mechanical stimuli cancel out the centre, so no pain</p>

<p>lateral inhibition: not to ÅØ spatial overlap, but to ÅØ overlap between modalities</p>

<p>very small mechanical stimulus Åﬁ pain, without causing tissue damage</p>

<p>e.g. thorns + drawing pains (useful if barefoot)</p>



<p>pain felt at certain level of firing when heat is applied</p>

<p>Åﬁ different level of pain with same rate of firing with pressure</p>

<p>feeling of pain s not directly proportional to firing of í°∆painí°« fibres</p>



<p>descending control from <a href="brain.html">brain</a>: endorphins + enkephalins</p>

<p>neuropeptides (= the natural opiates) - transmitters + hormones</p>

<p>Åﬁ analgesia if injected intravenously ÅÆ periaqueductal grey</p>

<p><a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> pathway from periaqueductal grey ÅÆ raphe nucleus in the medullary <a href="reticular%20formation.html">reticular formation</a></p>

<p>which ÅÆ descending fibres to <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a>, which inhibits the transmission of afferent pain impulses through an enkephalin-releasing spinal inter-<a href="neuron.html">neuron</a></p>

<p>thus the pain fibres projecting to the periaqueductal grey = a -ve feedback system to modify its own transmission</p>


<p>Proprioception</p>

<p><a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a> =</p>

<p>information about the positions + movements of our limbs</p>

<p>the forces generated by our muscles</p>

<p>attiude + <a href="motion.html">motion</a> relative to the earth</p>



<p>2 types of proprioceptors in voluntary muscles</p>

<p>both ë°÷ stretch receptors. different function because different situation in the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> as a whole</p>



<p>spindles - respond to <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> length + rate of change of length</p>

<p>in parallel with the main contractile elements</p>

<p>\ their stretch Åµ stretching of the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> itself</p>

<p>Golgi tendon organs - <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> tension, force</p>

<p>in the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> tendons, in series with the contractile elements and the load</p>

<p>\ their stretch Åµ the tension exerted by the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a></p>


<p>Spindles</p>

<p>= found in all the striated muscles in the body</p>

<p>fluid-filled capsule &lt;4mm long, ends attached to the exterior sheaths of neighbouring <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> fibres</p>

<p>inside: small number of intra-fusal fibres, with contractile ends, mid contains the nuclei</p>



<p>2 main types of intra-fusal fibres</p>

<p>nuclear chain fibres - thinner, nuclei lined up in a row</p>

<p>nuclear bag fibres - pronounced bulge in the middle, nuclei bunched together</p>

<p>usually 5 or 6 intra-fusal fibres/spindle</p>



<p>2 kinds of afferent fibres innervate the spindle:</p>

<p>primary fibres - larger (group Ia) - branches to the central portions of both kinds of fibre (nuclear chain/bag) - annulospiral endings</p>

<p>dynamic, very pronounced adaptation</p>

<p>proportional to rate of change of stretch (and partly proportional to <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> length)</p>

<p>secondary fibres - (group II) terminate as annulosopiral/flower-spray endings, mainly on nuclear chain fibres, more peripherally than the Ia endings</p>

<p>group II fibres: non-adapting/static - proportional to the degree of stretch of the spindle at any moment</p>



<p>possible causes for adaptation is sensory receptors:</p>

<p>energy filtering - static information is thrown away before transduction</p>

<p>membrane adaptation - even steady conductance at the ending ÅÆ fall off in firing frequency</p>

<p>in the Pacinian corpuscle: both</p>

<p>in the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> spindle - mainly energy-filtering (like the concentric lamellae of the Pacinian corpuscle)</p>

<p>the contractile portions of the intrafusal fibres behave as much much more viscous than the central portion</p>



<p>spindles also receive motor innervation from Ag (g-fibres)</p>

<p>2 types of fusimotor fibre - static and dynamic</p>

<p>Åﬁ cause <a href="contraction.html">contraction</a> of the peripheral regions of the spindle which stretches the sensory elements Åﬁ Å≠ firing of the afferent fibres</p>

<p>effect of g-stimulation (on the afferent fibres) ë°÷ extra stretch being applied to the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> as a whole</p>

<p>= Å≠ the sensitivity of the endings to stretch</p>

<p>the CNS can control the sensitivity of the spindle afferents and also their adaptational properties</p>


<p>Golgi tendon organs</p>

<p>similar appearance to the Ruffini organs in the skin</p>

<p>respond to tensionin their associated tendon</p>

<p>innervated by group Ib afferents</p>

<p>seemed to have high thresholds - large forces were necessary over the whole tendon to make them fire</p>

<p>actually, they respond well to tensions generated by the <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> fibres they are joined to</p>

<p>rather than the overall tension being shared out amongst the tendinous fasiscles</p>

<p>respond to tension, rather than <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> length</p>

<p>usually reciprocal to the spindles during active movements</p>

<p>because extra fusal activity Å≠ tension + ÅØ length</p>

<p>passive movements - spindles + tendon organs = in step</p>


<p>Central pathways</p>

<p>both modalities use similar sensory pathways</p>

<p>fibres enter the dorsal roots</p>

<p>most <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> in a spinal nucleus = Clarkeí°«s column</p>

<p>ascend homolateral posterior spinocerebellar tract ÅÆ <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a></p>

<p>rostral afferents ascend ÅÆ accessory cuneate nucleus of the <a href="medulla.html">medulla</a>; then the cuneocerebellar tract</p>

<p>or the spino-olivary tract ÅÆ the inferior olive which projects via climbing fibres ÅÆ <a href="cerebellar%20cortex.html">cerebellar cortex</a></p>



<p>apart from ascending ÅÆ <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a>, <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a> fibres are involved in various reflex mechanisms within the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a></p>

<p>especially the stretch reflex (simplest = monosynaptic <a href="excitation.html">excitation</a> of a motor <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> by a Ia afferent)</p>

<p>some projection of <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> proprioceptors ÅÆ cortex via the ventral posterior <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a></p>


<p>Joint receptors</p>

<p>another important source of information about limb position and movement:</p>

<p>mechanoreceptors in ligaments and the capsules of joints</p>

<p>variety of morphological types - similar to those int eh skin</p>

<p>Pacinian corpuscles + Golgi-like endings (large group I axons)</p>

<p>Ruffini endings (group II)</p>

<p>small nerve ifbres with unencapsulated endings</p>



<p>some:</p>

<p>complete adaptation = sensitive to rate of change</p>

<p>incomplete adaptation = signal limb position too</p>



<p>problem: most receptorsí°« í°∆<a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> angleí°« &lt; ÅΩ the entire range the joint - Å≠ sensitivity to change in position within that range</p>

<p>\ information about limb position is coded by frequency of firing, but also which neurons are firing</p>

<p>in some joints: afferent fibres fire most at extremes to warn of dislocation</p>

<p>other joints: the majority are mid-range</p>

<p>afferent information from joints follows the same pathways as corpuscles in the skin</p>

<p>fibres ascend in the ipsilateral posterior columnns</p>

<p>then relay in the cuneate + gracile nuclei</p>

<p>cross, then via the medial lemniscus ÅÆ ventral posterior lateral <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a>, then to <a href="somatosensory%20cortex.html">somatosensory cortex</a></p>

<p>or to the spinocerebellar pathways</p>


<p>Conscious <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a></p>

<p>joints contribute to <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a> (especially static)</p>

<p>tested: by injecting anaesthetics into the synovial fluid</p>

<p>or cuff blocking blood to the joint but not the muscles</p>

<p>hip replacement - mechanoreceptors are lost, reduced sensitivity to join position (using information from the muscles + skin)</p>



<p><a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> receptors help with <a href="proprioception.html">proprioception</a></p>

<p>surgeons pull on exposed tendons Åﬁ conscious patients report a sense of limb movement</p>

<p>vibrator on <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>/tendon: stimulates the Ia stretch <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> endings preferentially because of the high rates of stretch it generates</p>

<p>Åﬁ illusion of <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a> shortening, even if held stationary</p>



<p><a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>                   predominantly change of position; sense of weight</p>

<p>joints                     predominantly static position</p>

<p>skin                        predominantly load (and perhaps position sense)</p>

<p>efference copy       predominantly load</p>


<p>Vestibular apparatus</p>

<p>see book</p>


<p>Anatomical methods</p>

<p>horse radish peroxidase (HPP)</p>

<p>retrograde trasnmission - identify the origin of efferents)</p>

<p>Golgi silver stain</p>

<p>stains whole neurons at random</p>

<p>procion yellow</p>

<p>most of a single <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> to make the micro-electrode cell</p>

<p>labelled amino acids (e.g. tritiated leucine)</p>

<p>orthograde: identify where the soma projects to</p>

<p>related technique for tracing axonal pathways</p>

<p>to study the degeneration resulting from injury to a nerve fibre</p>

<p>2 kinds of degeneration:</p>

<p>orthograde/Wallerian degeneration - distal to the cut</p>

<p>retrograde - in the direction of the cell body</p>



<p>Nanta stain identifies certain of the orthograde degeneration products</p>

<p>retrograde degeneration Åﬁ various characteristic change in the cell body</p>



<p>transneural - when the degeneration change extends beyond the <a href="synapse.html">synapse</a> to affect the next <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> along</p>

<p>problem with degeneration studies - can't tell whether the <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> originates in the damaged area, or is just connected to a fibre which passes through</p>



<p>select cells associated with a particular protein</p>

<p>usually a peptide transmitter</p>

<p>using immunohistochemical stains = labelled antibodies which enable the identification of a group of cells within a nucleus which share common function</p>


<p>Physiological methods</p>

<p>imaging</p>
