<h2>Drug addiction</h2>

<h3>From <a href="sara.html">sara</a> notes</h3>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p><a href="drug%20addiction.html">drug addiction</a> = substance dependence (???)</p>

<p>addiction = physical dependence (???)</p>

<p>reinforcement and <a href="motivation.html">motivation</a> are crucial parts of substance
dependence</p>

<p>tolerance = loss of an effect of a drug with repeated
administration</p>

<p>withdrawal = the appearance of symptoms associated with the
termination of chronic drug abuse.</p>

<p>self administration: level pressing, intravenous vs. oral
self administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">measured with dose response curves</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">also <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stimulation.  <strong>Drugs of abuse make <a href="brain.html">brain</a>
stimulation more rewarding, or decrease thresholds for
ICSS. Also: place conditioning. Animals return to place
where drug was last received.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>positive vs negative reinforcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">initial rush/good feeling of drug is positive
reinforcement</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">withdrawal symptoms are negative reinforcement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>motivated behavior: involves areas of <a href="midbrain.html">midbrain</a> and forebrain
and connections between both through medial forebrain
bundle. Brain monoamine systems travel through here. VTA (in
<a href="midbrain.html">midbrain</a>)- <a href="basal%20forebrain.html">basal forebrain</a> (<a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a>, olfactory tubercle,
<a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>, <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>), and DA connections between the
VTA and Basal Forebrain (Mesolimbic DA system). Also: opioid
peptide systems, <a href="GABA.html">GABA</a> systems, and <a href="serotonin.html">serotonin</a> systems
involved with DA.</p>

<p>Cocaine/Amphetamine</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Adding this to system increases the amount of DA, NE and
5-HT in the synapse.  They do this by blocking reuptake or
enhancing release of neurotransmitters. But reinforcing
effects depend critically on DA. Mesolimbic DA system
especially implicated. DA antagonists into <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a>, <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>
block cocaine and amphetamine self-administration in rats.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Particularly important for reinforcing action of cocaine:
shell of <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a> and <a href="central%20amygdaloid%20nucleus.html">central amygdaloid nucleus</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Opioids</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Discovery of endogenous opioids and opioid receptors in
the <a href="brain.html">brain</a>. Opioid antagonists block heroin
self-administration when drugs injected into the VTA and
<a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a>. But DA antagonists do not block heroin
self-administration. Both regions are important for
reinforcing opioid dependence, but both DA- dependant and
DA-independent opioid mechanisms are important.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nicotine: agonist at nicotinic acytlcholine receptors in
<a href="brain.html">brain</a>. Three <a href="neurotransmitter.html">neurotransmitter</a> systems are involved: opioid,
cholinergic, and DA systems. Nicoline activateds both the
<a href="mesolimbic.html">mesolimbic</a> DA system and endogenous opioid systems.</p>

<p>Alcohol: <a href="GABA.html">GABA</a> has a role in alcohol abuse? <a href="GABA.html">GABA</a> antagonists
reverse behavioral effects of alcohol, and also decrease
alcohol reinforcement. Effects central amygdaloid
nucleus. DA receptor antagonists work in the same
way. However, destroying DA terminals does not stop
self-administration of alcohol. DA transmission not
absolutely critical. Host of other chemicals are involved:
<a href="glutamate.html">glutamate</a>, 5-HT, opioids. Increase in 5-HT decreases
voluntary intake of alcohol. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone,
naloxone) reduce self-administration of alcohol.</p>

<p>THC: binds to cannvinoid-1 receptor, found throughout the
<a href="brain.html">brain</a>, especially in <a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a>. THC increases DA in the
shell of the <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a>.</p>

<p>Extended Amygdala: shell of <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a> extends into centromedial
<a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. Sends projections to palladium, VTA, reticular
formation, raphe nucli, LH. Connections between the extended
<a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> and the <a href="hypothalamus.html">hypothalamus</a>. Key between drug <a href="reward.html">reward</a> and
natural <a href="reward.html">reward</a> mechanisms.</p>

<p>Chronic drug administration compromises the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> <a href="reward.html">reward</a>
systems. <strong>Withdrawal from prolonged self-administration of
cocaine in rats increases ICSS <a href="reward.html">reward</a> thresholds. Naloxone
is an opiate antagonist increases <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stimulation.</p>

<p>Increases in drugs, decreases <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stimulation.  Decreases
in drugs/withdrawal, increases <a href="brain.html">brain</a> stimulation.</p>

<p>Neurochemical adaptation in <a href="reward.html">reward</a> neurotransmitters. During
alcohol, opiate, and cocaine withdrawal, extracellular DA
and 5-HT levels in <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a> decrease.</strong>*</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Also, there are DA postsynaptic changes in the <a href="NuAcc.html">NuAcc</a>. Long
term changes in receptor function in <a href="mesolimbic.html">mesolimbic</a> DA system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stress increases with drug abuse and withdrawal.  Brain CRF
levels rise, esp. in <a href="central%20amygdaloid%20nucleus.html">central amygdaloid nucleus</a>. <strong>Stress
chemicals (CRF/NE in <a href="locus%20ceruleus.html">locus ceruleus</a>) rise in limbic
forebrain with chronic drug use </strong></p>

<p>Opponent process model (Soloman, 1977): initial hedonic
state associated with drug, followed by negative affective
state. With time, hedonic state becomes smaller and smaller,
while negative affective state (affective withdrawal)
becomes larger and larger. We see this in <a href="brain.html">brain</a>: with
chronic drug use, decreased function of <a href="reward.html">reward</a>
neurotransmitters (DA) and increased <a href="brain.html">brain</a> <a href="stress.html">stress</a>
neurotransmitters (NE, CRF).</p>

<p>Neuroadaptive processes underlie substance dependence: Is
drug dependence due to positive reinforcing effects of drug
or due to the negative reinforcing effects of withdrawal
symptoms?  Sensitization theory vs. neuroadaptation theory.
Sensitization theory: drug causes <a href="sensitization.html">sensitization</a> of the
<a href="mesolimbic.html">mesolimbic</a> DA system, and therefore creates
craving. Neuroadaptation theory: (ex- opponent process
theory) continued drug use lead to neuroadaptation to the
presence of the drug, leads to development of a negative
affective states, and leads to self-medication of the
affective state. Allostasis: both theories work together to
create addiction.</p>
