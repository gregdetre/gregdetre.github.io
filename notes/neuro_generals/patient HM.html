<h5>What's common to these unimpaired tasks?</h5>

<p>see <a href="implicit%20memory.html">implicit memory</a></p>




<h3>Unsorted</h3>

<p class="first">mishkin - attempted to learn from monkeys</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">tried to make <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>-specific lesions like HM's</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">they were able to learn visual discriminations</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>monkeys were only supposed to touch the button if it
matched, e.g. a circle</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>this was mishkin's equivalent of skill <a href="learning.html">learning</a></p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">delayed alternation</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>lots of ways to do alternation</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>e.g. show circle, then circle goes away, delay, then
circle comes back next to other <a href="shape.html">shape</a> - monkey is
supposed to press the new <a href="shape.html">shape</a></p>
</center>

<center>
<p>easier to train them to go for the novel stimulus</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>they had trouble with this, I think</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>graziano didn't think it was a good analogue of
medium term <a href="memory.html">memory</a> - they only had to maintain the
<a href="memory.html">memory</a> for a few seconds</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>this is more like stm</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>so the thought was that monkeys were so stupid that
it was like ltm</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">aspiration lesions</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>opens up the skull, sucks out the surface to get a
narrow straw thing in</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>so you have to make a hole in the surface to get to
the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>, and just hope that that bit of cortex
isn't important</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">squire - improved lesion techniques - radiofrequency</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">put in an electrode, and pass <a href="current.html">current</a> in at certain
frequencies</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">able to test what would have happened if cortex above
and surrounding <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> and <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> is damaged</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">found that if you just damage the <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a>, then you
only get a very weak deficit on the stm task</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but when you damage perirhinal and parahippocampal,
completely wipes out monkey's ability to remember over
short periods of time</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>huh???</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>he pointed out that these areas receive input from a
wide range of sensory input¡Ä</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> - used for tagging situations/memories with
emotional valence</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Other patients</h3>

<p class="first">similar deficits in other patients</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">from bilateral lesions of the limbic association areas of
the <a href="medial%20temporal%20lobe.html">medial temporal lobe</a>, from surgery or disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HM's not the only person with these kind of deficits, but
the only one through surgery</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">see <a href="patient%20NA.html">patient NA</a></p>
