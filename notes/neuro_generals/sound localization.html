<h3>Barn owl</h3>

<p class="first">facial disk</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">characteristic of all owls</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">best developed in the barn owl</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">It consists of several layers of densely packed, stiff
feathers located in circular rings. Each feather has a
wide shaft and short barbs, and bends forward near the
tip. In addition, two prominent grooves in the facial
disk run from either side of the mouth up past the <a href="ear.html">ear</a>
openings. These grooves are not unlike the grooves in
our outer <a href="ear.html">ear</a>, which help funnel sounds into the <a href="ear.html">ear</a>. An
essential feature of the facial- disk grooves is that
the feathers lining them are designed to reflect high
frequency sound waves into the <a href="ear.html">ear</a>. Consequently, the
grooves in the facial disk selectively concentrate and
direct to the ears such sounds as the squeaks of mice
and rustle of leaves.&quot;</p>
