of the sound at the two ears will differ</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the delay would be zero</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">at 90deg to the right or left</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the inter-aural delay would be up to 50microns</p>

<p>ongoing time disparity</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">for low frequency sounds (&lt;1400Hz)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">a continuous tone can be localised by phase difference</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">at higher frequencies</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">where the wavelength of the sound is less than the
distance between the two ears</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the phase or time difference of a continuous tone
becomes ambiguous, because the phases could align along
multiple cycles</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the head acts as a sound shield, reflecting and
absorbing the shorter wavelengths of sound to produce an
interaural intensity difference</p>

<p>use neurons in concert to phase-lock onto different cycles
of high frequency sounds</p>

obtained in the cochlear</p>

<p><a href="sound%20localization.html">sound localization</a> of direction</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">sound pressure = scalar, rather than vector. inherenly
non-directional</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">therefore a simple pressure detector (such as the moth
<a href="ear.html">ear</a>) is unable to determine the direction of the sound
source</p>
