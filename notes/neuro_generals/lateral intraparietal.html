<h2>Lateral intraparietal cortex</h2>

<h3>Aka</h3>

<p class="first">LIP</p>



<h3>Connected</h3>

<p><a href="frontal%20eye%20fields.html">frontal eye fields</a></p>



<h3>Mechanism</h3>
<a name="mechanism" id="mechanism"></a>
monkey LIP responds to both visual stimulia and eye
movements (according to <a href="sara.html">sara</a>)

<p>Gottlieb et al, 1998 stable-array task</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">showed that <a href="lateral%20intraparietal.html">lateral intraparietal</a> cells were selective for
salient stimuli (even if they don't require a behavioural
response)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">apparently they care about <a href="endogenous%20attention.html">endogenous</a> and <a href="exogenous%20attention.html">exogenous</a>
salience???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Constantinidis &amp; Steinmetz, 2000</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">small group of <a href="lateral%20intraparietal.html">lateral intraparietal</a> and <a href="7A.html">7A</a> neurons
responded preferentially when <a href="attention.html">attention</a> had to be shifted
to a new location</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">e.g. for invalidly cued targets</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>From prosem</h3>

<p class="first">coding of high level movement - cf mountcastle's command
neurons</p>

<p>stimulate - saccadic eye movement</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">respond right before eye movement</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="attention.html">attention</a> vs motor control - centerd here</p>

<p>delayed saccade task</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">stimulus appears, and some time later, monkey gets signal
to make the saccade</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">fires during stimulus, then a bit during the <a href="memory.html">memory</a>
period, and then just before motor starts</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">anderson - thinks it's intention/motor control</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">goldberg - thinks it's just <a href="attention.html">attention</a> for that area</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">anderson - showed that if you have to reach instead of
saccade, it fires less - argues more for movement than
<a href="attention.html">attention</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">goldberg - argues that it's just that movement requires
less <a href="attention.html">attention</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>can't separate movement plan from <a href="attention.html">attention</a> - both
inextricably bound together for this kind of task</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so one sort of <a href="attention.html">attention</a> is your <a href="motor%20system.html">motor system</a> planning</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so can't we just say that that <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a> in delayed saccade
is firing for the combination of <a href="attention.html">attention</a> and intention,
so for attending to that area and planning to perform a
certain kind of action in that area???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">sounds like that's where graziano sees the consensus
going</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the classic view is that first you decide to attend
somewhere, and then you start the motor plan</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>but apparently that classic view is turning out to be
backwards, i.e. motor plan directs <a href="attention.html">attention</a></p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">matt - suggested a saccade task where the nature of the
saccade signal tells the monkey where to saccade</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>graziano: so there's always a confound between attending and
planning - ???</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">anderson: experiment comparing LIP and MIP (he calls it
PRR - parietal reach region)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">either supposed to saccade to it or to reach towards it</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>if you reach, it's MIP - don't respond so much where
you're going to saccade</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>LIP neurons tend to respond according to where you're
going to saccade</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>chris: are those two areas really independent? surely
you look where you're going to reach?</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>graziano: no - you usually look first, then there's
a very predictable lag, then you reach - videos of
people making peanut butter sandwich :)</p>
