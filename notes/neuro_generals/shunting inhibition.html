<h2>Shunting inhibition</h2>

<p class="first">when you add more Cl- <a href="ions.html">ions</a> to the <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a>, it doesn't have
much of an effect on the <a href="resting%20potential.html">resting potential</a>, but i think
it makes it harder to then activate that <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">&quot;Gain control refers to modulation of a <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a>'s
responsiveness to input; it is critically important for
normal sensory, cognitive, and motor functions
(1-5). Gain control is achieved through a divisive
process and is observed as a change in the slope of the
input-output curve. A longstanding and widely cited
candidate mechanism for gain control is shunting
inhibition (6, 7) such as that mediated by <a href="GABA.html">GABA</a>-gated Cl
¡Ý conductance, which decreases input resistance with
little direct effect on <a href="membrane%20potential.html">membrane potential</a> (Vm).&quot;</p>
