<h3>From tutorial - Iles</h3>

<p class="first">Tutorial - Iles, <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a></p>

<p>Dr Iles, week II</p>


<p><a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> - in order to lift up, e.g. primates</p>

<p>movement made under visual control</p>

<p>learned to some extent, probably takes a few months to
co-ordinate, partly trial + error</p>

<p>open loop or pre-programmed - visual input is used to
specify the motor programme, but corrections are being
continually made if the objects move</p>

<p>almost irrepressible corrections (see reading list Pisella,
Grea et al 2000, Nature neurosci)</p>

<p>direction of object - needs to be body-centred</p>

<p>good evidence for those kind of coordinate transformations
in the PPC</p>

<p>object distance - <a href="stereopsis.html">stereopsis</a> (best at 1m), needs independent
information about where your eyes converge - cells in the
<a href="parietal%20cortex.html">parietal cortex</a> (???)</p>

<p>starting position of limb provided by kineshetic - <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>
spindle, cutaneous, joints etc. - all project to the PC</p>

<p>start and end position defines a trajectory - close to
straight line trajectories , bell-shaped velocities</p>

<p>also: grip force, hand <a href="shape.html">shape</a>, finger aperture, posture, lift
force etc.</p>

<p>some evidence tha they might be organised in the PC</p>

<p>Goodale: shown that lesions in the PC affect these, whereas
lesions in the ventral stream do not affect them</p>

<p>effects of illusions, e.g. size illusions fool perceptual
but not <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> system</p>

<p>some that effect estimates of weight (which is probably
ventral anyway)</p>

<p>most of the necessary components/information fits/feeds into
the dorsal system</p>

<p>where else is involved in <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a>?</p>

<p>motor + pre-motor</p>

<p>lesion evidence, functional imaging, PET (premotor related
to self-paced movements)</p>



<p>main approach = chronic recording in conscious monkeys</p>

<p>(first done by Evarts)</p>

<p>Georgeopolous - studied <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> on conscious operant
trained monkeys - suggested that the firing varied according
to direction of movement - overall movement out of the
vector sum of individually-tuned populations of neurons</p>

<p>Kadaska and Crammond tried movement from A-B with different
patterns/postures - argued that he from iring of some of the
neurons changed, so they werení°«t coding just for directions
- indeed, some were affected by load-bearing</p>

<p>Kakei (recent) monkey different grips ÅÆ different muscles to
more up-/down - in the premotor, mainly specifies overall
direction of movement oblivions of which muscles do what int
eh motor, a significant number were related to <a href="muscle.html">muscle</a>
activation (2001, Nature Neurosci, vol 4, pg 1020) (1999,
Sci, vol 285, pg 3136), though there were a small number
coding for direction in space</p>

<p>so where are the details of the motor output mainly
specified?</p>

<p>possibly sub-cortical, but because theyí°«re highly-learned,
could go on with the <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a></p>

<p>massive projections from PPC ÅÆ <a href="pons.html">pons</a> ÅÆ <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a>, and back
to motor cortex via <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> + caudate, or even the basal
ganglia (there are projections from PPC ÅÆ BG ÅÆ premotor
(e.g. bradykinesia akinesia in Parkinsoní°«s))</p>

<p>or even in the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a>? Lundberg et al - hindlimb of the
cat, but some on the forelimb of the cat, even though we doní°«
t normally think of cats <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> out</p>

<p>transparent tube with food at the end, and cats had to put
their paw through tube + manipulate - showed that there is
manipulation masked by the fur</p>

<p>looked to se how primary motor is wired to spinal - no
direct connecitons, though there are via 1 or 2
inter-neurons, plus an indirect paht that has a different
function</p>

<p>CST travels down different part of <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> so could
lesion</p>

<p>propriospinal lesion affected <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a>, direct affected
manipulation</p>

<p>giant fibres in lobster ÅÆ almost complete tail-flip escape
respnose from command neurons in spine</p>

<p>cats are carnivores + weí°«re primates - very distant common
ancestor with limited <a href="vision.html">vision</a> + <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a></p>

<p>opposite argument in í°∆On the origin of skilled forelimb
movementsí°«</p>

<p>says that <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> + manipulation movements are actually
quite widespread, so the machinery underlyingn might be
distributed + conserved in the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> (???)</p>

<p>Dessolini - human neurophsyiology experiments - many
phenomena attributed to propriospinal in cat, so Åﬁ hope for
some simple <a href="reaching.html">reaching</a> located in the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a></p>

<p>Lemon worked on monkeys - should be easy enough to reveal
propriospinal tract</p>

<p>found no evidence for it in rhesus anaesthetised monkeys</p>

<p>Lemon on conscious monkeys, found no evidence for
propriospinal mediated actions</p>

<p>some responses though in squirrel monkesy, so Whisaw +
Iwaniak might be right in attributing same movements further
back - but, squirrel monkeys have poor control of movement</p>

<p>rubrospinal (from the mid-<a href="brain.html">brain</a> <a href="red%20nucleus.html">red nucleus</a>)</p>

<p>rubrospinal said to be absent, so might be a need for
propriospinal in man</p>

<p>frogs - highly specialised amphibia</p>

<p>frogs are adept at reoving things from body surface, even
spinal frogs</p>

<p>stimulating part of <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> Åﬁ hindleg movement to a
particular position (Bitzy)</p>

<p>but can't be confident that this is activating an unnatural
part of the <a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a></p>

<p>rats flexor reflex - similar to frogsí°« reflex</p>

<p>might be stimluating cutaneous afferents by accident</p>

<p>Anderson - intention in the PC?</p>

<p>intention seems less related to irrepressible corrections</p>

<p>self-paced - more <a href="medial%20premotor%20cortex.html">medial premotor cortex</a>, like
<a href="supplementary%20motor%20area.html">supplementary motor area</a> - probably responsible for
readiness potentials</p>

<p><a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a> may also be implicated</p>

<p>intention probably comes in many different guises, including
perhaps PC</p>

<p><a href="parahippocampal%20cortex.html">parahippocampal cortex</a> - involved in <a href="memory.html">memory</a></p>

<p><a href="cingulate%20cortex.html">cingulate cortex</a> - <a href="memory.html">memory</a> + intention (just underneath
supplementary motor cortex)</p>

<p>place fields in the rat <a href="hippocampus.html">hippocampus</a> - probably more for
finding its way round the environment, spatial learning etc.</p>

<p>(Paus(???), 2001, Nature Neurosci - anterior cingulate
cortex - motor + cognitive interface)</p>

<p>accept the 2 stream model of <a href="vision.html">vision</a> as useful simplifying
model but be careful</p>

<p>Livingstone + Hubel - inputs are not purely p- and m- though
- thatí°«s mixedu p</p>

<p>how distinct are they anatomically - Young (Nature, 1992, pg
155)</p>



<p>parallel processing - look at the IT side, and face
recognition</p>


<p>Questions</p>

<p>open loop vs pre-programmed</p>

<p>alien hand syndrome</p>

<p>PC shows that ÅΩ of the visual system at least, needs
embodiment</p>

<p>NN constraint satisfaction = good for ill-posed problems</p>

<p>where is premotor/somatosens???</p>

<p><a href="spinal%20cord.html">spinal cord</a> is conservative</p>

<p>readiness potentials - signal couple of seconds before
execution</p>

<p>Sakata - important for distance of object</p>
