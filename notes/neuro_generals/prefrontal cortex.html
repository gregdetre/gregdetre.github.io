<h5>Dorsal <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> (areas 46 and 9)</h5>

<h5>Summary pg 153</h5>

<p>Areas 9 and 46 receive their main input from the parietal
lobe which processes information about the animal itself,
and about the space in which it moves and manipulates
things.</p>

<p>Monkeys with lesions in area 46 fail to learn delayed
response tasks. These are conditional tasks on which the
animal must choose between locations on the basis of
information in <a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a>. These impairments can be
demonstrated on an oculomotor version of the DR task on
which monkeys must direct their <a href="eye%20movements.html">eye movements</a> on the basis
of locations in which they recently saw a spot of
light. During the delay on this task, many cells in area 46
change their activity selectively according to the location
of the target.</p>

<p>Monkeys with lesions in area 9 and 46 are impaired at
selecting between objects on the basis of their past
responses, and also at generating a series of actions. In
PET scanning expeirments with human subjects, the dorsal
<a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> is activated when the subjects generate a
series of actions at will. In patients there is also a
relation between psychomotor retardation and a decrease in
regional cerebral blood flow the dorsal prefrontal
cortex. This suggests a role for the dorsal prefrontal
cortex in generating actions.</p>



<h5>Ventral <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> (areas 11, 12, 13 and 14)</h5>

<h5>Summary pg 170</h5>

<p>The <a href="ventral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">ventral prefrontal cortex</a> receives a multimodal input
from the temporal lobe. Monkeys are impaired at <a href="learning.html">learning</a>
what response to make, irrespective of the modality of the
cue. There is also evidence suggesting that it may not be
essential that there is a delay between the presentation of
the cue and the opportunity to respond; however, this
evidence is not conclusive. It is argued that the ventral
<a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> selects the goal - e.g. an object - given
the <a href="current.html">current</a> context.</p>

<p>When monkeys learn visual concurrent discriminations, they
can solve the problems by <a href="learning.html">learning</a> only about the
associations between the stimuli and <a href="reward.html">reward</a>. Monkeys with
ventral prefrontal lesions can learn such problems at a
normal rate. Furthermore, when human subjects make
perceptual judgements, there is no activation in the
<a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="ventral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">ventral prefrontal cortex</a> is heavily interconnected with
the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a>. Monkeys will learn to deliver rewarding
stimulation to the orbital cortex or to deliver rewarding
drugs. It is argued that the connections between the ventral
<a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> and the <a href="amygdala.html">amygdala</a> are involved in the
process by which responses are selected on the basis of
their success.</p>




<h5>Basal ganglia</h5>

<h5>Summary pg 201</h5>

<p>The <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> can influence the <a href="premotor%20cortex.html">premotor cortex</a> by
cortico-cortical connections and projections through the
<a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a>. Monkeys are severely impaired at relearning a
visual conditional motor task if lesions are placed in the
ventral <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a> so as to disrupt the influence of the basal
ganglia on <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>.</p>

<p>There are cells in the <a href="basal%20ganglia.html">basal ganglia</a> that fire well before
movements when monkeys are repeating a movement from <a href="memory.html">memory</a>
or deciding what movement to make.</p>

<p>The <a href="premotor%20cortex.html">premotor cortex</a> also interact with the <a href="cerebellum.html">cerebellum</a> via the
ventral <a href="thalamus.html">thalamus</a>. Patients with cerebellar pathology are
slow to learn conditional tasks. There is also activation of
the lateral <a href="cerebellar%20cortex.html">cerebellar cortex</a> when subjects habitually
produce the same words in response to cue words.</p>

<h5>Notes - Neuroimaging branching study in Nature</h5>

<p>Using imaging technology, scientists from the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) found
that a specific type of multitasking behavior, called
branching, can be mapped to a certain region of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a>
that is especially well developed in humans compared to
other primates. The study will appear in the May 13, 1999,
issue of the journal Nature.1</p>

<p>&quot;The results of this study suggest that the anterior
<a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a>, the area of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> that is most
developed in humans, mediates the ability to depart
temporarily from a main task in order to explore alternative
tasks before returning to the main task at the departed
point,&quot; says Jordan Grafman, Ph.D., Chief of the Cognitive
Neuroscience Section at the NINDS and a co-author of the
study.</p>

<p>The investigators used functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), which measures changes in blood flow to the <a href="brain.html">brain</a>,
to view the brains of volunteers while they performed
branching tasks. The region of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> that is involved in
multitasking is called the fronto-polar <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a>
(FPPC).</p>

<p>Tasks performed by the volunteers involved exercises to test
<a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a>, attentional focus, and a combination of the
two. All of the subjects, who were healthy, normal
volunteers, participated in all of the task groups. The task
groups consisted of a control task, a delayed-response task,
a dual-task, and a branching conditions task. Dual-task
involves changing focus between alternative goals
successively. The investigators predicted that subject
performance on the individual delayed-response task and
dual-task conditions would not activate the FPPC. They did
predict that the branching task which involves problem
solving and planning would stimulate activity in the
FPPC. According to the fMRI data, their predictions were
correct. The FPPC was activated only during those tasks that
involved an interaction between <a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a> and
attentional focus decisions.</p>

<p>The FPPC is the region of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> that controls complex
problem solving and is especially well developed in humans
as compared to other primates. The study showed that the
FPPC selectively mediates the human ability to multi-task.</p>


<h5>Abstracts</h5>

<h5>Braver &amp; Barch - Common and selective <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> regions engaged by <a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a> and intentional encoding</h5>

<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
examine the role of the <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> (<a href="PFC.html">PFC</a>) in both
long-term <a href="memory.html">memory</a> (LTM) encoding and <a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a> (WM)
tasks involving a variety of material types (words, faces,
and pictures). Encoding was studied in a task requiring
intentional memorization of items for a later recognition
test. WM was studied in the two-back condition of the n-back
task. Bilateral <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was
found to be jointly activated in both encoding and WM. This
region also showed material-specific lateralization in both
tasks, with the left hemisphere more active for words and
the right hemisphere more active for faces. <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> regions were
also found that were selective to either encoding or
WM. Right dorsolateral <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> was selectively activated during
WM, but showed no material-specificity, while left anterior
<a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> was selectively activated during encoding of faces and
pictures. Activity in <a href="medial%20temporal%20lobe.html">medial temporal lobe</a> was also
observed, with the left hemisphere engaged by both <a href="memory.html">memory</a>
tasks, and the right hemisphere showing significant activity
only during encoding. The finding of <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> regions jointly
activated during both encoding and <a href="working%20memory.html">working memory</a> tasks
suggests that these regions may subserve cognitive processes
important for both short-term active maintenance and
long-term memorization. Conversely, the finding of selective
activation in specific <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> regions and <a href="medial%20temporal%20lobe.html">medial temporal lobe</a>
suggests that these <a href="brain.html">brain</a> areas may be functionally
specialized. Moreover, the results indicate that a complete
characterization of the cognitive functions performed by <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a>
and other <a href="brain.html">brain</a> areas will be best served by integrating
findings across multiple <a href="memory.html">memory</a> domains.</p>


<h5>Braver &amp; Barch - Mechanisms of Cognitive Control: Active Memory, Inhibition, and the Prefrontal Cortex</h5>

<p>Previous research has identified the <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> (<a href="PFC.html">PFC</a>)
as a <a href="brain.html">brain</a> region that is critical for cognitive
control. Currently, theorists remain divided about whether
to view the <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> as primarily a coordinative, mnemonic, or
<a href="inhibitory.html">inhibitory</a> structure. A theory is presented that attempts to
resolve some of the apparent conflicts between the
predominant views on <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> control functions. In this theory,
<a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> is proposed to actively maintain representations of
context information. These maintained representations
provide a mechanism of control by serving as a top-down <a href="bias.html">bias</a>
on the local competitive interactions that occur during
processing. As such, it is suggested that <a href="PFC.html">PFC</a> performs both
mnemonic and <a href="inhibitory.html">inhibitory</a> functions in the service of control,
and that each is preferentially observable under different
task situations. A series of behavioral, computational, and
neuroimaging studies are presented that demonstrates how
this theory can account for a wide range of data associated
with performance of a simple <a href="cognitive%20control.html">cognitive control</a> paradigm.</p>

<p>Primates are unique among mammals in possessing a region of
<a href="dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a> with a well-developed
internal <a href="granular%20layer.html">granular layer</a>. This region is commonly associated
with higher cognitive functions. Despite the histological
distinctiveness of primate <a href="dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a>,
the work of Rose, Woolsey, and Akert produced a broad
consensus among neuroscientists that homologues of primate
granular <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a> exist in nonprimates, and can be
recognized by their dense innervation from the mediodorsal
thalamic nucleus (MD). Additional characteristics have come
to be identified with <a href="dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a>,
including rich dopaminergic innervation and involvement in
spatial delayed-reaction tasks. However, recent studies
reveal that these characteristics are not distinctive of the
dorsolateral prefrontal region in primates: MD and
dopaminergic projections are widespread in the frontal lobe,
and medial and orbital frontal areas may play a role in
delay tasks. A re-evaluation of rat <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a> suggests
that the medial <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>, usually considered to
homologous to the <a href="dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.html">dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</a> of
primates, actually consists of cortex homologous to primate
premotor and <a href="anterior%20cingulate%20cortex.html">anterior cingulate cortex</a>. The lateral
MD-projection cortex of rats resembles portions of primate
orbital cortex. If <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a> is construed broadly
enough to include orbital and <a href="cingulate%20cortex.html">cingulate cortex</a>, rats can be
said to have <a href="prefrontal%20cortex.html">prefrontal cortex</a>. However, they evidently lack
homologues of the dorsolateral prefrontal areas of
primates. This assessment suggests that rats probably do not
provide useful models of human dorsolateral frontal lobe
function and dysfunction, although they might prove valuable
for understanding other regions of <a href="frontal%20cortex.html">frontal cortex</a>.</p>
