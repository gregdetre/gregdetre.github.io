<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps part of the problem with current conceptions of rationality
is that they may conflate a number of components, which together give rise to
what we consider to be rationality. This is a specific application of a broad
idea currently popular in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, which goes
under many names, including modularity, the multiple drafts hypothesis
(Dennett), the society of mind. I will adopt Dennett�s terminology of �multiple
drafts�, used to refer to concurrent, restricted processes or modules, which
interact, influence each other and compete for control of the system. At
different times, different modules will dominate, allowing us to react flexibly
in a variety of situations, and to literally �contain multitudes�<a

<h2>Taxonomies of rationality</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are an enormous number of different ways in which we
could try and divide up rationality, some resulting in similar taxonomies.</p>

<h3>Evolutionary age</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most evolutionarily ancient part of the brain is the
hindbrain. Its broad design can be traced evolutionarily to our reptilian past.
It links directly to the spinal cord, controlling basic functions like
respiration, heartbeat etc. On top of this rests the �mammalian� mid-brain, at
a slightly higher level. The highest level is the neocortex, a 6mm surface (in
humans) that we share only with the most intelligent species like primates and
dolphins. In conjunction with various sub-cortical areas, the cortex is
responsible for all higher-level processing. It might be possible in the
long-term future to try and separate the various roles played in reasoning by
the different areas, though it seems likely that almost all of what we would
really term rationality occurs in various parts of the cortex.</p>

<h3>Linguistic/non-linguistic</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a definite appeal to the idea that some of our
reasoning is non-linguistic in some fashion. This can be taken in several ways:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo11;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>In opposition to the Language of Thought Hypothesis, the processing
of the brain cannot be described in language-like syntactic manipulation of
symbols<span style='color:red'>...</span> <span style='color:blue'>Relates back
to Smolensky�s stronger connectionist thesis???</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo11;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>Sometimes we seem to be performing a task which we only afterwards
express in propositional/linguistic terms, e.g. thinking in an imagistic
fashion. When faced with two similar but not identical pictures, we are usually
able to point out the difference between them. This seems like a clearly
non-linguistic piece of reasoning (i.e. �accessing objectively valid truths�),
since we certainly don�t appear to be representing every single component,
object and shape propositionally and making comparisons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>why is this important??? what bearing would it have on our
view of rationality if one or the other did turn out to be definitely the
case???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>maybe bin this section<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>Domains of rationality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>domain in which you�re using it, ecological, e.g. theory of
mind, mathematical, inferential � Tooby &amp; Cosmides etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>induction vs deduction???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it possible that the scientific and the logical domains
of reasoning actually reflect fundamentally different rational processes??? Not
really, the more I think about it.</p>

<h3>Levels of rationality, minimal/idealised rationality, degrees of
objectivity</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we could show that the demands placed on our reasoning
are somehow less for naturalistic reasoning than for <i>a priori</i> or
philosophical reasoning, then we might be able to accept a naturalistic account
of the limitations of philosophical reasoning, while avoiding any attempts by
philosophers to show that such arguments are self-refuting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can we understand this idea of levels of rationality? Is
it simply that different domains of thought/discussion place greater or fewer
demands on our intellect? That our brains just get them right more often? Or
that they are somehow fundamentally, of their nature, easier to grasp, and
their conclusions are easier to draw? Or even less satisfyingly, simply because
we just have no choice but to take some things as given, otherwise our mental
scaffold can never get off the (wholly skeptical) ground?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cherniak provides one approach to considering degrees of
rationality. In particular, he is attacking an idealised, (more or less)
all-or-nothing conception of rationality that he claims authors like <span
style='color:red'>Dennett, Davidson, Quine and Cohen??? support</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>He accuses Davidson in �Psychology
as philosophy� of saying that we need a �large degree of consistency� but
actually arguing for ideal consistency, as does Quine�s translation policy.
Inconsistency can be very difficult to unmask, if the logical relations are
convoluted, and the inconsistency implicit � also, we tend to compartmentalise
our beliefs, only comparing beliefs within a subset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>He attacks Dennett�s claim that �as
we uncover apparent irrationality under an Intentional interpretation of an
entity, our grounds for ascribing any beliefs at all wanes� � Cherniak argues
that this is not the case for above-minimally rational creatures. I�m not so
sure � a just-above minimally rational creature might seem to hold only a
skeleton few set of beliefs. It�s a matter of degree, really.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cherniak is looking to explain why intentional explanations
are so successful as a means of predicting and understanding others� behaviour.
By intentional explanations, he refers to the attribution of a cognitive
systems of beliefs, desires, perceptions etc. He wants to show that too weak a
conception of rationality is insufficient to explain the success of these
intentional explanations, while too strong a conception is unable to either,
for different reasons, as well as being wholly inapplicable to human beings in the
real world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His �minimal general conditions for rationality� have to lie
between what he characterises as the �assent theory of belief� and the �ideal
conditions of rationality�. The assent theory of belief considers that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>An agent believes �all and only those statements which he would
affirm�, i.e. that believing a proposition consists simply in having an
accompanying �feeling of assent�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Almost anything goes in such a caricatured theory, since it
places no inherent consistency constraints, and no system by which inferences
can be drawn from a given set of beliefs. As a result, it is quite unable to
explain the predictive success of assuming intentionality in other people,
since an agent is free to hold any beliefs he chooses � or at least, there is
no systematic way of predicting, deducing or explaining which beliefs such an
agent would have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the opposite end of the spectrum, Cherniak characterises
the ideal general rationality criterion as:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>An ideally-rational agent with a particular belief-desire set would:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>make all of the sound inferences from his belief set<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>eliminate all inconsistencies that arise in his belief-set<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>undertake all actions which would, according to his beliefs, tend to
satisfy his desires</i> (termed �apparently appropriate actions�)<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves no room for �sloppiness�. Sloppiness in
Cherniak�s sense is almost a technical term, encompassing all of the factors
which undermine our deductive ability. These include: laziness or carelessness;
the difficulty of the deduction to be made (i.e. whether it is convoluted,
indirect, requiring numerous unrelated-seeming premises); cognitive limitations
(e.g. short-term memory); time constraints; and so fundamentally, the �finitary
predicament�. We have finite-sized brains, a finite time available to us, and
so we are restricted in the number and range of inferences we can consider, let
alone draw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason that these idealisations are made is that they
allow us to simplify to a manageable level human behaviour sufficiently to
formalise it in disciplines which deal with an enormous mass of human
interactions, like economics.<span style='color:red'> However</span>, we don�t
like them because�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is particularly keen to attack the idea that an agent
actually believes (or infers, or can infer) all consequences of his beliefs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't think that any of the philosophers whom Cherniak
accuses of idealising rationality would explicitly accept the premise couched
in those terms. It is obvious that that would require infinite resources, since
it would probably require analysing some belief-sentences that could not be
stated, let alone understood, within the agent�s lifetime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cherniak considers the Goldbach conjecture. We have a set of
axioms, a conjectured inference, and yet we are unable to tell whether the
inference follows deductively. Appeals to more prosaic cognitive limitations like
short-term memory, carelessness or simply failing to take into account relevant
premises by accident cannot explain our failure. In one sense, the problem is
simply that the space of possible mathematical proofs is far far too big for us
to be able to search through it. This feels like a simple concession to
Cherniak�s statement of our finitary predicament. But I think it concedes far
more than that � because the space in which we operate on a daily basis when
acting rationally is almost always far huger than we can possible search. And
if this is the case, then we simply are not rational in the way that Nagel
requires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The minimal rationality conditions he sets out are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A minimally-rational agent with a particular belief-desire set</i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>would:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>make some, but not necessarily all of the sound inferences from his belief
set<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>eliminate some (but not necessarily all) inconsistencies that arise in
his belief-set<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>attempt some, but not necessarily all, of those actions which would,
according to his beliefs, tend to satisfy his desires</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>not attempt most (but not necessarily all) of the actions which are
inappropriate given that belief-desire set </i>(termed the corresponding
�negative rationality� requirement)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
color:blue'>We also know which reasoning tasks are more difficult for humans than
others, i.e. a weighting of deductive tasks with respect to their feasibility

likely to be drawn = the theory of feasible inferences. He leaves it as an open
question whether the most �obvious� inferences (like modus ponens) could be
performed by any creature that qualifies as having beliefs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can relate this to the factors Cherniak lists under his
theory of feasible inferences. Some inferences are easier and more likely to be
drawn as a result of their feasibility for the reasoner. He leaves it as an
open question whether the most �obvious� inferences (like modus ponens) would
be considered so by non-humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>Theory of human memory structure �
helps you know which beliefs will be recalled when, e.g. whether the premises

the inactive belief set. Of course, I think it would be an even more powerful
theory if it was couched in connectionist terms of association, rather than
discrete subsets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cherniak skips over the difference between conscious and
unconscious inferences, and explicitly makes the assumption that our entire
belief-desire system can be expressed as a finite set of
(logically-interpretable) sentences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others have taken a similar approach, notably Simon and
Goldman.</p>

<h3>Performance vs competence</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohen distinguishes between performance and competence,
which amounts to the distinction between how well you actually do something,
and how well you are (potentially) capable of doing that task. In the same way
that a superb sportsman may have an off-day because of lack of sleep, or
nerves, our <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>performance</i> as reasoners (e.g.
in various psychological tests) may be significantly inferior to our <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>competence</i> on a good day. This could be
for a variety of quite prosaic reasons, such as the ones given above for the
sportsman, as well as a few deeper and more specific ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>give better examples of failures of
performance<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohen uses the example of English grammar. Although we
regard most speakers of the English language as competent grammarians, insofar
as they can distinguish grammatical and ungrammatical sentences very reliably,
our performance varies a great deal � we often make grammatical errors during
the slapdash flurry of a casual conversation, including grammatical errors that
we could identify as errors. Cohen argues that the only way to define the
grammar of a language is through the careful intuitions of what Rorty might
term an ideal community of speakers of that language. The job of linguists is
to systematically describe the sum of careful, intuitive grammatical judgements
given by just such a group of intelligent, fluent (probably native) speakers.
Where obvious schisms do appear between groups of speakers, then we can say
that we have distinguished dialects within the language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the same way, �the only way to tell that modus ponens and
modus tollens are valid inference rules is that competent thinkers judge
arguments of this form to be good ones. Note that this does not mean that
competent thinkers will never be misled by the presentation of an argument and
fail to recognize that modus tollens is an applicable inference rule.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leads convincingly towards a sort of reflective
equilibrium view of human reasoning, where normative reasoning criteria are
based on the intuitions of ordinary people. These intuitions have been
systematically described in greater and greater detail, from Aristotle through
to Frege, �constructing a coherent system of rules and principles by which
those same people can, if they so choose, reason much more extensively and
accurately than they would otherwise�. Thus, �human rationality, in the sense
of the possession of a basic competence in judging inferences to be logically
sound, follows from the fact that we can only know what the rules of logic are
by comparing them to what people intuitively judge to be logically sound.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>The question remains as to whether
this process leads to objective truths � after all, it seems to be relativising
rationality to a human consensus�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>Cohen�s approach allows us to see
degrees of rationality in terms of degrees of objectivity(???)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He describes the process by which our rational intuitions
are honed in a similar way to Nagel�s description of how we move towards
objectivity � we take a subjective view, and attempt to step back from it to
�form a new conception which has that view and its relation to the world as its
object�.</p>

<h5>How do we explain the experimental results</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cohen explains the results of psychological research into
human inferential failings as resulting from �either the presentation of the
problem, or from subjects' inability to properly encode the logical structure
of the task being presented�, both of which are failures of performance rather
than competence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The overall thrust of Cohen's conclusion is that the
research on human inferential shortcomings should be construed as showing how
subjects can be vulnerable to &quot;cognitive illusions&quot; when problems are
presented in unfamiliar ways that interfere with their inferential performance,
not as showing that human beings lack the logical competence to deal
effectively with reasoning problems, in that they systematically rely on
&quot;heuristics&quot; rather than on correct logical rules.(???)</p>

<h3>Forward/backward</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, I want to consider trying to divide our reasoning
process into what I will term �forward� and �backward� reasoning, although the
divide might sometimes be better termed �open/closed� or even
�sub-conscious/conscious�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To illustrate the difference, consider the game of chess.
When faced with an early or mid-game board position, we can assume that neither
a human or (foreseeable) computer player could consider all the legal remaining
moves. However, with varying degrees of success (and subject to practice and
understanding of the rules), a human player will only have a handful of the
best moves presented to his consciousness. The brain has somehow
sub-consciously searched <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>forwards</i>
from a starting position through an enormous space, of which our awareness is
limited to only the most optimal solutions eventually found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast, if in the post-game analysis your opponent
points out his reasons for making or not making a given move (probably couched
partly in terms of intentional mental states and partly in terms of the rules,
mechanics and future moves of the game), then your comprehension and careful
assessment of those reasons is working <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>backwards</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same distinction works in the case of a philosophical
discussion. We might start by outlining the premises upon which everyone
agrees. We are now faced with the task of deciding what valuable, substantive
conclusions we can safely draw, i.e. reasoning forwards. The vast majority of
conceivable inferences will be nonsensical, irrelevant, and/or indeterminable
from the premises, but we will hardly even register any of these. Our minds
will then be drawn towards a small number of (hopefully) articulable, relevant,
contestably sound inferences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of these, we will consider, debate, discard and argue for
some on the basis of reasons (reasoning backwards), assessing the validity of
the arguments. Of course, we might have started with this phase first if
someone was reading a paper, or expounding a view, or in another situation
where we weren't having to work forwards beating an argument-path for
ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The process continues with a continual revision of the
original premises, including and removing, each time intuitively seeing how
this affects the possible inferences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps one way of putting this is to say that forwards
reasoning is the process by which we effectively produce the reasons for one
course/choice rather than another, although we are not really literally
producing the reasons so much as noting the particular courses/choices for
which good reasons exist. The Cartesian method of doubt is perhaps the
paradigmatic example of this. Backwards reasoning is the process by which we
then carefully elaborate and weigh up the respective reasons behind the
available choice, and make our evaluation. Both types of reasoning necessarily
complement each other, and we constantly employ them together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to note that forward reasoning need not be
the instantaneous revelation that this outline depicts. Sometimes inferences
are immediately visible, and other times it takes considerable time and
concentration to see new possibilities (though this effort of concentration
does not lift the shroud of mystery under which our subconscious processes
operate). This is probably most easily explained at the neural level � neural
networks often take many �time-steps� to settle into an attractor, i.e. a
solution which satisfies as many of the constraints as possible within which
the network has been trained to operate. An analogy is often drawn with a
system like a roulette wheel, where the ball takes a considerable time to
settle into an equilibrium, i.e. its resting place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, they both fail at times. In either case, we could
be considered to be irrational, but in different ways. In the case of forwards
reasoning, a mistake manifests itself as falsely believing an inference to be
consistent or entailed by the premises, or just failing to draw all of the
interesting, sound inferences from the belief set. In this way, backward
reasoning acts as a more methodical check on the results of our forward
reasoning. We can all think of times when we have failed initially to see why a
mathematical proof or argument follows for given reasons, only for it to become
obvious suddenly.</p>

<h5>Could they be experimentally separated?</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>It might be interesting at some point in the medium-term
future to consider some sort of neuro-imaging study on whether different parts
of the brain, or a different control process is operating, when undergoing
purely forward or backward reasoning tasks. The two considerable difficulties
with such an approach are that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l5 level1 lfo12;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>We have really very little idea how any sort of high-level
cognitive functioning can be understood on a neural level. Disambiguating
�reasoning� from all of the processes going on in the brain at once just may
not prove possible, or even to be a well-posed or meaningful task. It may be
that reasoning simply emerges out of the pandemonium of a number of
domain-specific systems, in which case looking for the neural correlate of
�pure� reasoning would be as nonsensical as looking for the neural correlate of
pattern-matching or the Cartesian theatre � they simply do not exist as
separate, definable entities in modern cognitive psychology.</p>

</span><![endif]>Designing an elegant, reproducible experiment with clear
results looks to be a very difficult task. It requires us to be able to
conceive of tasks that require the subject to engage in only backward or
forward reasoning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think it�s difficult and probably a mistake to try and be
more specific at this stage about what exactly is going on when we reason
forwards � I imagine it as some huge attractor network spanning various central
cognitive systems in the brain, incorporating a huge number of cognitive
representations of the world at various levels of abstraction, as well as
linguistic and sensory information to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could it be that the abstract space being formed is actually
much smaller than the total space of grammatical propositions, and that that�s
why the search gets quicker � this could explain what forward reasoning really
is, and how paradigm shifts, insights and new approaches fit in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Where does this all leave us?</h2>

<h3>Nozick</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nozick�s account is attractive in a number of ways. It can
be accommodated with minimal metaphysical commitments, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Its price is that it does not really face Nagel head on �
Nozick is content to admit that he is not explaining rationality �from first
principles�(???) � he is presupposing a degree of rationality in order to
consider oneself rationally. And, as I will discuss later, this is the only
position that I think we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>can</i> take as
philosophers. On the one hand, we face an empty, skeptical suspension of belief
since we recognise that in order to hold <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>any</i>
justified beliefs whatsoever, we first require a justified belief about our
ability to form such beliefs. And yet, in suspending our belief, we have
already recognised that this is the only <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rational</i>
option. In this way, Nagel�s characterisation of �thoughts that we cannot get
outside of� is particularly appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way, it�s obvious that we could never monitor our
entire brain � with what would we be doing the monitoring? Where can we stand
that we can view our position from any position but our own? Can we turn our
eyes back upon our own skull (in a more meaningful sense than just the
eyeball-rolling party trick)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>So we have little choice but to
accept that simply being able to frame the question of one�s own rationality is
a sort of base condition for rationality. Doubting is, of necessity, a kind of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rational</i> thinking. Descartes� <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cogito</i> may thus serve instead to
bootstrap us (or evidence that we have already boot-strapped) into knowledge of
our own rationality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps it�s not so much the doubting about questioning
one�s own rationality, as simply being able to conceive of rationality at all.
Perhaps the complex notion of rationality is its own key. Being able to
conceive abstractly of context-independent, formal, generalisable methods and
propositions, or perhaps the notions of context-independence, formality,
generalisability, method or proposition collectively form the tip of a
cognitive framework iceberg comprising a syntax-manipulating,
representation-of-representation mind, even a fallible, specialised, evolved
one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3>Incompatibility</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>My stated intention at the start of this paper was to
investigate how easily a naturalistic framework and rational objectivism can
accommodate each other. I was hoping and expecting to find that they were
incompatible in certain fundamental, ineradicable ways. Given that I feel that
we are far better scientists than philosophers, this would have further
persuaded me that the reason we disagree on almost all non-empirical issues is
that we are not sufficiently rational or powerful thinkers to make real headway
in such areas. This would not necessarily be to dismiss out of hand the entire
philosophical enterprise, but it would undermine it in those areas where there
is no support from other disciplines to provide arbitration in disputes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As it has turned out, I have found even a restrictive,
contemporary naturalistic account to be surprisingly pliable with respect to
our rational capacities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>our performance is usually pretty low for both backward and
forward reasoning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>however, our <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>competence</i>

to address � he just assumes that all of our beliefs can be expressed
propositionally. I don't think this places too high demands. the problem is
that we are usually unable to introspect to exactly what our beliefs are, or we
ignore beliefs, or fail to unmask assumptions</p>
