<h2>The moral law</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kant�s moral law is a �categorical imperative�. It is
discoverable <i>a priori</i>, i.e. through reason without reference to
experience or the senses, as opposed to <i>a posteriori</i>, i.e. the senses,
experience or empirical facts. An imperative is more than just a command, but a
�command of reason�, so that if we were governed by reason alone we would infallibly
abide by it. By �categorical�, he means that it is good in itself, as opposed
to �hypothetical� imperatives which are merely good because they are means
towards something. It might be argued that something can only be rational as a
means to a desired end. In answer, we could say that though this may be true of
hypothetical imperatives, a categorical imperative is, by definition, rational
in its own right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>So act that you treat
humanity, both in your own person and in the person of every other human being,
never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end. </i>�
Groundwork, 428</p>

<h3>Which are the ends that are also duties?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are the ends that are also duties:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>one�s own perfection<span
style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>happiness of others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These cannot be inverted to become �the perfection of
others� and �my own happiness� for they are done of their own accord, as
opposed to �duty� which is a �necessitation to an unwillingly adopted end�.
When promoting other people�s happiness, they may choose ends which are not
permitted, because they infringe others� freedom or conflict with their ends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Every action is right if it
or its maxim allows each person�s freedom of choice to coexist with the freedom
of everyone in accordance with a universal law</i> � M, 230-1, Universal
principle of right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, actions can be morally indifferent � neither required
nor forbidden. �Fanciful virtue� is when one becomes overly concerned with
dutifully performing such morally indifferent acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only source of value is moral law. Only a good will is,
without qualification, good � not through its actions, but through its willing.
The highest good consists in an overall unity of virtue and happiness.</p>

<h2>Duty</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kant�s method, he says, is to start with ordinary people�s
jumble of beliefs and try to abstract to the supreme underlying principle
(analytic), then use it to work back towards the problems affecting our lives
(synthetic).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Morality is prescriptive (unlike hypothetical imperatives).
It is impossibly to conceive of a moral requirement without recognising that
that is what one <i>ought</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> to do
and that there is no rational, moral reason for not doing it. Moral
requirements are categorical imperatives � they are automatically reasons for
action, even though I may of course choose not to act even so. It is in this
sense that it is a moral �law�, rather than that it can be neatly codified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>Three propositions
detail the moral as the source of value and guide for conduct:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>The only thing that can give an action moral worth is acting out of a
sense of duty. Acting out of inclination may be in accordance with duty but if
it is not out of duty, it has no moral worth. A properly virtuous person is one
in whom there is a �firmly grounded disposition to fulfil one�s duty exactly�.
Freedom of will is autonomously choosing to act as though according to a
universal law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>It is not the effects of an action, but the intention (the maxim being
acted upon) that determine its moral character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>�Duty is the necessity of acting out of respect for the law� �
Groundwork, 400. By necessity, he does not mean that we are automata, but that
we recognise that if we want to be moral we must obey the moral law.</span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Respect� and �interest� are confusing ideas which may be
connected with feelings, but boil down to a willingness to accept the primacy
of the moral law and act accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kant has difficulty with whether or not his practical laws
can work in the same way as theoretical principles. They are objective and
prescriptive � he believes that we can know a conclusion is entailed by
premises yet refuse to actively draw it in the same way that we are free to
fail to act on a moral law even though we know about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Hume and Quine would seek to undermine the <i>a
priori</i> altogether, which Kant�s account could not survive. Kant did not
believe initially that Hume could possibly be so radical an empiricist as to
deny all <i>a priori</i> knowledge, including, for example, maths. His answer
to Hume�s attack on our notions of causality rests on our need for some
foundational principles in order to be able to interpret experience at all,
principles that cannot themselves derive from experience. After all, Kant says,
such empiricists would not be able to argue rationally about these things at
all if no <i>a priori</i> tenets are allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moral law must also be universal: �I ought never to act
except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim become a universal
law�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As for those who act wrongly out of a misguided sense of
duty, their actions have no moral worth even though they might seem to. In his
example of an inquisitor trying a heretic, Kant says that the inquisitor has
allowed his feelings to invade his moral judgement, i.e. his conscience, and
that he needs to reflect and listen to the voice of reason.</p>

<h2>The categorical imperative</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Walker develops finer points on the above. The categorical
imperative stipulates that one should act as though one�s action become a
�universal law of nature�, a stronger claim that applies universally to all
occasions and rational beings � moreover, it is not merely saying that it be a
maxim that anyone can follow, but one that <i>everyone</i> can follow.
O�Neill�s example of a maxim to buy but not sell is batted aside by adding the
caveat �� provided that others want to sell them�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four casuistical questions are discussed � that of a lying
promise, Frederick the Great�s preparation to suicide rather than be ransomed,
allowing one�s talents to rust in the pursuit of enjoyment and paying no
attention to the needs of others. In each case, Kant endorses the traditional
moral standpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is an important qualification that is easily missed
about Kant�s technical use of the term �will� to mean practical reason, i.e.
wants as constrained by rationality (�Willk�rather than merely a desire
for something, which may be good or evil (�Wille�). He also adds the principle
of autonomy, which is subtly different???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Kingdom of ends is a utopia of harmonised ends and
dutiful good for the perfection and happiness of all. </p>

<h2>A phantom of the brain?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kant addresses the problem of freedom in a causally
deterministic world in an interesting way. Because freedom is critical for
moral responsibility, and the motivation/intentions of an act determine its
moral value, Kant needs to consider how there can be morality if we are all
effectively automata. His answer refers back to his <i>Critique of Practical
Reason</i> and the distinction he makes there between the world of appearances
(phenomena) which we inhabit in time and space, and the world as it is in
itself (nuomena) which is intelligible really only to God. He seems to be
saying that although we appear to be automata in the world of appearances, our
underlying moral freedom is encoded in the rationality of the timeless
underlying reality. He regards this metaphysics as the bedrock below which we
may not delve in our philosophy of morality, and bids us act as though we are
free and in these circumstances his system will work.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does reason lead one so indubitably to these
conclusions? Is there a logical progression leading from premises to his moral
law as formulated?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>No. Walker portrays Kant as
believing that one can investigate no deeper and they must be taken as given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don�t understand how a person can be kind and nice without
failing to be sufficiently dutiful and moral.</p>
