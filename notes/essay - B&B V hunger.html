<p>Thursday, 25 May, 2000</p>
<p>Prof. Rolls � B&amp;B V hunger</p>
<p>hunger</p>
<p>brain mechanisms which control appetite and motivation</p>
<p>reading � just the starred ones</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The question, �How is food intake controlled?� has a deceptively simple answer: �I eat when I�m hungry�</p>
<h2 id="main">Main</h2>
<p>hunger as a homeostatic drive</p>
<p>2 signals: for hunger and for satiety</p>
<p>hunger signals:</p>
<p>2 theories of why we start eating � glucostatic and lipostatic theories</p>
<p>set point vs settling point</p>
<p>satiety signals:</p>
<p>satiety cascade</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<h2 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h2>
<p>food + water are rewards (in that the organism will work to obtain them)</p>
<p>signals (which originate internally) operate to alter (modulate) the reward value with food/water has for the hungry/thirsty organism</p>
<p>2 separate aspects of information processing of the sensory stimulation produced by food:</p>
<p>decoded as a physical stimulus</p>
<p>then coded in terms of reward value</p>
<p>the learning of which visual stimuli are (or are associated with) food/water:</p>
<p>takes place in specialised parts of the brain for this type of learning</p>
<p>functions of the:</p>
<p>different factors outside the brain (e.g. taste, smell, gastric distension)</p>
<p>the control signals (e.g. the amount of glucose in the blood)</p>
<p>which sensory inputs produce rewards</p>
<p>and which inputs acts as hunger/satiety signals to modulate the reward value of the sensory inputs</p>
<p>how the brain:</p>
<p>integrates these different signals</p>
<p>learns about which stimuli in the environment provide food</p>
<p>initiates behaviour to obtain the correct variety + amount of food</p>
<h2 id="central-factors">Central factors</h2>
<h3 id="ventromedial-hypothalamus">Ventromedial hypothalamus</h3>
<p>Frohlich�s syndrome (1902)</p>
<p>over-eating and obesity associated with damage to the base of the brain</p>
<p>Hetherington (1943)</p>
<p>lesions of VMH, even after hypophysectomy, cause overeating and obesity. Therefore, the VMH provides a neural control of how much is eaten</p>
<p>Le Magnen (1973)</p>
<p>VMH lesions p roduce hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>York &amp; Bray (1972)</p>
<p>the overeating and obesity produced by VMH lesions are abolished if the vagus is cut, preventing the hyperinsulinemia</p>
<p>therefore, VMH lesions affect eating indirectly, by causing an elevation of insulin, which then stimulates feeding</p>
<p>the VMH could certainly affect the body weight �set point� in this way, indirectly</p>
<h3 id="lateral-hypothalamus">Lateral hypothalamus</h3>
<p>Hess, Brugger (1943)</p>
<p>electrical stimulation of the LH elicits feeding</p>
<p>Anand &amp; Brobeck, 1951</p>
<p>lesions of the LH produce aphagia and adipsia</p>
<p>Stellar, 1954</p>
<p>the LH as a �hunger� centre</p>
<p>Winn &amp; Dunnett, 1984</p>
<p>ibotenic acid LH lesions, which spare fibres of passage, produce aphagia</p>
<p>therefore, the LH is involved in the control of feeding</p>
<p>what is its role?</p>
<p>Rolls, 1976</p>
<p>LH neurons respond to the taste of food</p>
<p>LH neurons respond to the sight of food</p>
<p>LH neurons� responses to the taste + sight of food are modulated by hunger</p>
<p>Sensory-specific satiety discovered in LH neurons, and then in feeding behaviour</p>
<p>LH as interface between sensory inputs which produce reward, and the hunger/satiety signals that modulate reward</p>
<p>LH outputs may produce rewards and autonomic responses to the taste + sight of food</p>
<p>how do inputs reach the LH?</p>
<h3 id="taste-pathways">Taste pathways</h3>
<p>tuning becomes more specific from the NTS through the primary taste cortex to the secondary taste cortex</p>
<p>satiety operates in the secondary taste cortex, but not before � representation of reward here</p>
<p>sensory-specific satiety effects are shown by orbitofrontal cortex neurons</p>
<p>the mechanism + adaptivfe significance of computation of sensory-specific satiety in the orbitofrontal cortex</p>
<h3 id="olfactory-pathways">Olfactory pathways</h3>
<p>satiety modulates olfactory responses in the secondary olfactory cortex (in the orbitofrontal cortex)</p>
<p>multimodal, e.g. olfactory + taste neuronal responses are found in the orbitofrontal cortex � representation of flavour</p>
<p>learning can influence the formation of olfactory-taste associations:</p>
<p>the computation of new multimodal representations by learning � the representation in the OFC of the reward association of the odour</p>
<h3 id="visual-pathways">Visual pathways</h3>
<p>from the inferior temporal cortex directly and via the amygdala to the orbitofrontal cortex</p>
<p>in the orbitofrontal cortex, but not in the inferior temporal cortex, neuronal repsonses to the sigh of food are modulated by hunger: reward is represented</p>
<p>visual-taste association learning is also reflected in the responses of OFC visual neurons, as shown by reversal</p>
<p>discrimination learning and particularly reversal, and also food selection, are impaired by orbitofrontal damage</p>
<h3 id="amygdala">Amygdala</h3>
<p>discrimination learning, and also food selection, are impaired by amygdala damage</p>
<h3 id="orbitofrontal-cortex">Orbitofrontal cortex</h3>
<p>discrimination learning (especially rapid reversal) and also food selection, are impaired by orbitofrontal cortex damage</p>
<p>the orbitofrontal cortex contains the secondary taste and olfactory cortices</p>
<p>the OFC builds representations of flavour</p>
<p>satiety modulates the taste, olfactory + visual representation of food in the OFC</p>
<p>sensory-specific satiety for the taste, smell and sight of food is computed in the OFC</p>
<p>the OFC has a representation of the texture of food</p>
<p>the OFC is involved in visual-to-taste and olfactory-to-taste association learning</p>
<h2 id="peripheral-factors">Peripheral factors</h2>
<h3 id="oropharyngeal-factors-especially-taste-smell">Oropharyngeal factors � especially taste + smell:</h3>
<p>provide reinforcement/reward</p>
<p>food is still reinforcing when it can only be tasted + smelled, and is not absorbed: evidence from sham feeding with oesophageal or gastric fistulae</p>
<p>small volumes, e.g. 0.1ml, provide reinforcement when provided orally</p>
<p>taste + smell guide intake � the preference/aversion function has the normal shape during sham feeding</p>
<p>provide only little satiety:</p>
<p>overfeeding with sham feeding</p>
<p>however, sensory-specific satiety is a contributory factor to satiety; and conditioned satiety can occur</p>
<h3 id="gastric-factors-distension">Gastric factors � distension</h3>
<p>not necessary for hunger/feeding:</p>
<p>hunger pangs are <em>not</em> closely associated with gastric contractions</p>
<p>gastrectomised humans feel hunger</p>
<p>eating still occurs after vagotomy which severs gastric afferents to the brain</p>
<p>necessary for normal satiety:</p>
<p>gastric preloads inhibit subsequent feeding</p>
<p>gastric emptying leads to a resumption of feeding</p>
<p>not sufficient for reinforcement:</p>
<p>intragastric food delivery is not reinforcing (i.e. are not worked for)</p>
<h3 id="duodenal-factors">Duodenal factors</h3>
<p>necessary for normal satiety:</p>
<p>duodenal sham feeding with a duodenal fistula: overfeeding occurs</p>
<p>duodenal feedback via an enterogastric loop is necssary for gastric distension to occur</p>
<p>food infusions to the duodenum produce some satiety via chemosensors: glucose via a vagal pathway, and fats by an endocrine pathway, as shown by the effects of vagotomy</p>
<p>cholecystokinin and bombesin, hormones releasted when food reaches the gut, themselves contribute to satiety as shown by infusions</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-role-of-peripheral-factors-in-feeding">Summary of role of peripheral factors in feeding</h3>
<p>|  Reinforcement |  Satiety  </p>
<p>---|---|---  </p>
<p>Oropharyngeal factors |  1 |  0  </p>
<p>Gastric and intestinal factors |  0 |  1  </p>
<p>Therefore, there must be an interaction (in the brain) between gastric + oropharyngeal factors, with satiety signals mediated by gastric + intestinal factors modulating the reward value of oropharyngela factors (taste + smell)</p>
<h2 id="gross-psychology">Gross - Psychology</h2>
<h3 id="homeostatic-drive-theory">Homeostatic drive theory</h3>
<p>homeostasis � Gk <em>homos</em> (same) and <em>stasis</em> (stoppage) � Cannon, 1929</p>
<p>= process by which an organism maintains fairly constant internal (bodily) environment</p>
<p>e.g. body temperature, blood sugar level, salt concentration in the blood etc.</p>
<p>a state of imbalance arises</p>
<p>something must happen to correct the imabalance and restore equiibrium</p>
<p>appropriate behaviour restores the internal balance</p>
<p>sates/reduces the homeostatic drive</p>
<p>Green (1980) � internal environment requires regular supply of raw materials from the external world</p>
<p>(in)voluntary/(dis)continuous</p>
<h3 id="does-hunger-cause-eating">Does hunger cause eating?</h3>
<p>hunger as the bit that happens during internal imbalance to signal the homeostatic drive</p>
<p>hunger = neither necessary or sufficient for eating</p>
<p>we eat when we�re not hungry and we don�t always eat when we are hungry</p>
<p>Blundell &amp; Hill (1995) and other experiments � strong link between intensity of experienced hunger sensations and the amount of food eaten</p>
<p><em>appetite control system</em> = hunger, eating and physiological mechanisms are coupled together (imperfectly)</p>
<p>circumstances of uncoupling, e.g. hunger strikes or eating disorders (obesity or anorexia nervosa)</p>
<h5 id="cannon-washburn-1912-swallow-a-balloon-if-youre-hungry">Cannon &amp; Washburn (1912) �Swallow a balloon if you�re hungry�</h5>
<p>believed that the hunger drive is caused by stomach contractions (hunger pangs)</p>
<p>Washburn swallowed an empty balloon tied to the end of a thin tube � pumped it up, then connected the tube to a water-filled U-tube so that Washburn�s contractions would cause an increase in the level of water at the other end of the U-tube</p>
<p>reported a pang of hunger every time a large stomach contraction was recorded</p>
<p>Carlson (1992) confirmed � patient with tube implanted through his stomach wall, just above his navel</p>
<p>when there was food in his stomach, small rhythmic contractions (peristalsis) mixed the food and moved it along the digestive tract</p>
<p>when it was empty the contractions were large and associated with the patients� reports of hunger</p>
<p>Pinel, 1993 � however, patients who have had their stomachs removed</p>
<p>e.g. oesophagus connected directly � duodenum (small intestine � the upper portion of the intestine through which most of the glucose and amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream)</p>
<p>still report feeling hungry and sated</p>
<p>still maintain normal body weights by eating more frequent, smaller meals</p>
<p>similarly: cutting neural connections to the brain (i.e. the vagus nerve) from the gastrointestinal tract (stomach + intestines)</p>
<p>has little effect on food intake in humans or animals</p>
<p>suggests that Cannon exaggerated the importance of stomach contractions in causing hunger</p>
<p>but the gastrointestinal tract still plays a part in hunger + satiety</p>
<p>if the vagus nerve is cut, signals from the gut can still get to the brain via the circulatory system</p>
<p>also, stomach loading (the presence of food in the stomach) is important in regulation of feeding</p>
<p>if the stomach exit to the duodenum is blocked off, rats still eat normal-sized meals, i.e. information about the stretching of the stomach wall � brain (via the vagus nerve)</p>
<h3 id="what-starts-a-meal">What starts a meal?</h3>
<p>the physiological signals to start and stop eating need not be the same (Carlson, 1992)</p>
<p>delay between the correctional mechanism (eating) and the change in the state of the body (several hours to completely digest)</p>
<p>\ the signals for hunger + satiety (the state of no longer being hungry) must be different</p>
<p>the information from the GIT � brain via the circulatory system:</p>
<p>concerns the components of the food that has been absorbed</p>
<p>the depletion of which nutrients acts as a signal to start eating?</p>
<p>fats (lipids)</p>
<p>carbohydrates (incl glucose)</p>
<p>vitamins/mineral salts</p>
<p>proteins/amino acids</p>
<p>fats + carbohydrates are burnt up in cellular reactions, providing the energy to fuel metabolic processes</p>
<p>metabolism = all the chemical processes occurring in the body�s cells essential for the body�s normal functioning</p>
<p>metabolic rate = the amount of energy the body uses</p>
<p>when we engage in vigorous physical activity, the muscles are fuelled by fats and carbohydrates</p>
<p>fat reserves are called adipocytes, which clump together as adipose tissue (fat)</p>
<p>carbohydrates are stored as energy as glycogen (a complex carbohydrate)</p>
<h5 id="glucostatic-theory">Glucostatic theory</h5>
<p>1940s/1950s glucostat:</p>
<p>primary stimulus for hunger is a decrease in the level of blood glucose below a certain set point</p>
<p>(with corresponding increase primary stimulus for satiety being an increase above this set-point)</p>
<p>glucose = the body�s (especially the brain�s) primary fuel</p>
<p>the glucostat = a neuron (probably in the hypothalamus) that detects the level of blood glucose</p>
<p>i.e. although it hadn�t been identified, it was assumed that there is a mechanism that responds to changes in the level of blood glucose</p>
<p>Mayer (1955) � influential because proposed that feeding regulates:</p>
<p>the glucose <em>utilisation</em> (the rate at which it is used)</p>
<p>rather than <em>absolute</em> blood glucose level</p>
<p>usually, utilisation and absolute blood glucose levels are very closely correlated</p>
<p>but Mayer could also account for <em>hyperphagia (over-eating)</em></p>
<p>e.g. diabetes mellitus � overeat despite high glucose levels, because their pancreas cannot produce the insulin necessary for the glucose to enter cells and be utilised</p>
<p>glucose utilisation = monitored by glucoreceptors that compare glucose entering + leaving the brain, �/span&gt; stimulates/inhibits feeding __</p>
<p>experiments appeared to locate the glucoreceptors (Mayer &amp; Marshall, 1958)</p>
<p>injected mice with gold thioglucose</p>
<p>the glucose binds to the glucoreceptors</p>
<p>which would be destroyed by the gold (a neurotoxin)</p>
<p>then the mice began to eat loads</p>
<p>examination showed damage to tissue in the VMH</p>
<p>ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) = <em>satiety centre</em></p>
<p>however: although a fall in blood glucose may be the most important physiological signal for hunger, it is not the only one</p>
<p>if eating were controlled exclusively by blood glucose, we would expect them to overeat and get fat (Carlson, 1992)</p>
<h5 id="lipostatic-theory">Lipostatic theory</h5>
<p>1950s + 1960s:</p>
<p>focuses on the end product of glucose metabolism � the storage of fats (lipids) in adipocytes</p>
<p>body fat is normally maintained at a relatively constant level</p>
<p>Kennedy (1953): everyone has a set-point for body fat, and deviations from this lead to compensatory adjustments in food intake</p>
<p>Nisbett (1972): fluctuations in the amount of stored fats largely determines variations in body weight � everyone has a body weight set-point</p>
<p>(hence the failure of short-term diets to produce long-term weight loss)</p>
<p>animal experiments � lesions in they hypothalamus:</p>
<p>damage to the lateral hypothalamus �/span&gt; rats will stop eating (even when food is readily available) to the point of starvation (aphagia)</p>
<p>was thought to indicate that the LH normally functions to stimulate eating</p>
<p>Keesey &amp; Powley (1975):</p>
<p>deprived rats of food then lesioned their LHs</p>
<p>they then started eating <em>more</em> food (not less)</p>
<p>in normal rats: the lesion lowers the body weight set point</p>
<p>if you lesion rats who are already below this set point: they increase feeding in order to reach the new (higher) set point</p>
<p>i.e. damage doesn�t affect feeding directly, but only by altering the body weight set point</p>
<h3 id="set-point-or-settling-point-thermostat-or-leaky-barrel">Set-point or settling point: thermostat or leaky barrel?</h3>
<p>Pinel (1993): the glucostatic + lipostatic theories are complementary, rather than mutually exclusive because:</p>
<p>glucostatic theory</p>
<p>was meant to account for the initiation + termination of eating, i.e. relatively short-term processes</p>
<p>lipostatic theory</p>
<p>was meant to explain long-term feeding habits and the regulation of body weight</p>
<p>both are based on the assumption that homeostasis implies the existence of set-point mechanisms</p>
<p>current biopsychological theories: body weight tends to drift around a natural <em>settling point</em></p>
<p>(the level at which the various factors influencing it are balanced)</p>
<p>early theorists seduced by the analogy of the thermostat</p>
<p>better analogy for settling point theory: the <em>leaky barrel model</em></p>
<p>the water level in a leaky barrel is regulated around a natural settling point rather than a predetermined set point</p>
<p>(i.e. a balance between the rate of water leaking out and the amount coming in???)</p>
<h3 id="what-other-factors-influence-what-and-how-much-we-eat">What other factors influence what and how much we eat?</h3>
<p>setting point theory is more compatible with research findings:</p>
<p>point to factors other than internal energy deficits as causes of eating (Pinel, 1993):</p>
<p>learning determines: what, when, how much and how to digest the food we eat</p>
<p>feeding system = flexible system that opertaes within certain general guidelines but is �fine-tuned� by experience</p>
<p>we are drawn to eat by food�s <em>incentive properties</em> , i.e. the anticipated pleasure-producing effects of food (<em>palatability</em>)</p>
<p>both internal and external factors influence eating in the same way, by changing the incentive value of available foods</p>
<p>signals from the taste receptors produce an immediate decline in the incentive value of similar tasting food</p>
<p>signals associated with increased energy supply from a meal produce a general decrease in the incentive properties of all foods</p>
<p>Rolls &amp; Rolls (1982): discovered LH neurons that respond to the incentive properties of food, rather than food itself</p>
<p>when monkeys were repeatedly allowed to eat one palatable food, the response of LH neurons to it declined, though not to other palatable foods</p>
<p>neurons that responded to the sight of food �/span&gt; respond to a neutral stimulus that reliably predicted the presentation of food</p>
<p>classically conditioned responses � cephalic phase responses</p>
<p>Pavlov (1927): the sight/smell of milk produced abundant salivation in puppies raised on a milk diet, but not in those raised on a solid diet</p>
<p>conditioned salivation to a metronome or a light bulb</p>
<p>or feeling hungry at certain times of the day when we usually eat, even if there is no energy deficit</p>
<p>could we learn to find things palatable in the first place?</p>
<p>innate preferences for tastes associated in nature with vital neutrients</p>
<p>e.g. sweetness detectors helped ancestors identify safe foods (even when not hungry, sweet tastes are pleasant, and sweet things tend to increase appetite (Carlson, 1992) )</p>
<p>but can also learn relationship between taste and post-ingestion consequences of eating certain food</p>
<p>taste aversion studies (Garcia et al., 1966):</p>
<p>rats learn to avoid novel tastes that are followed by illness</p>
<p>rats can learn to prefer tastes that are followed by infusion of nutrients + flavours that they smell on the breath of other rats</p>
<p>both rats and humans require a varied diet</p>
<p>humans usually prefer a plate of mixed foods than a huge plate of only one food</p>
<p>soon become tired of the same food = <em>sensory-specific satiety</em></p>
<p>cultural evolution e.g.</p>
<p>Mexicans � calcium by adding lime to tortillas</p>
<p>Europe + N America: prefer diets deterimental to our health</p>
<p>food manufacturers sell highly palatable + energy dense food with less nutritional value, �/span&gt; overeating, fat deposits + body weight</p>
<p>Blundell &amp; Hill (1995): this does not generates a compensatory biological drive to undereat</p>
<p>may explain � obesity</p>
<p>evolved a strong defence against undernutrition, weak defence against the effects of overnutrition</p>
<p>Pinel (1993): the number of different foods consumed in the West is so large that our bodies are unable to learn which foods are beneficial and which not</p>
<h3 id="what-stops-a-meal">What stops a meal?</h3>
<p>satiety = feeling �full up� or satisfied</p>
<p>meal size is influenced by several factors</p>
<p>Blundell &amp; Hill (1995)</p>
<p>satiety is not an instantaneous event, but occurs over a period of time</p>
<p>there are different phases of satiety, associated with different mechanisms</p>
<p>together, they comprise the <em>satiety cascade</em></p>
<p>(which maintains inhibition over hunger and eating during the early + late phases of satiety)</p>
<p><em>sensory effects</em></p>
<p>generated by the smell, taste, temperature and texture of food</p>
<p>inhibit eating in the very short term</p>
<p><em>cognitive effects</em></p>
<p>beliefs we hold about the properties of food</p>
<p>may inhibit hunger in the short term</p>
<p><em>post-ingestive effects</em></p>
<p>including gastric distension, rate of gastric emptying, release of hormones (e.g. CCK) and stimulation of GIT receptors</p>
<p><em>post-absorptive effects</em></p>
<p>mechanisms arising from the action of glucose, fats, amino acids (+ other metabolites) after absorption across the intestine into the bloodstream</p>
<p>post-ingestive and post�absoptive effects are the most important re suppression + subsequent control of hunger</p>
<p>food of varying nutritional composition will have different effects on the mediating processes</p>
<p>research into possible differences in satiating efficiency + capacity to reduce hunger between: protein, fat and carbohydrate</p>
<p>found so far:</p>
<p>carbohydrates are efficient appetite suppressants</p>
<p>the fat content of food influences its texture + palatability, but has a disproportionately weak effect on satiety</p>
<p>although the stomach may not be very important in causing hunger, it is important in satiety</p>
<p>the gastric branch of the vagus nerve carries emergency signals from the stretch receptors in the stomach wall � prevents us from overeating and damaging the stomach</p>
<p>signals from receptors that detect the presence of nutrients are transmitted to the brain by means of a chemical released into the blood by cells in the stomach wall (Carlson, 1992)</p>
<p>after food reaches the stomach, the protein is broken down into its constituent amino acids</p>
<p>as digestion proceeds, food gradually passes into the duodenum (small intestine), which controls the rate of stomach emptying by secreting a peptide hormone (short chains of amino acids) called cholecystokinin (CCK)</p>
<p>CCK is secreted in response to the presence of fats, detected by receptors in the walls of the duodenum</p>
<p>many studies have found that injecting CCK into hungry rats causes them to eat smaller meals</p>
<p>Wolkowitz et al (1990): gave people injections of a drug that blocks CCK receptors in the peripheral nervous system (but not in the brain)</p>
<p>they reported feeling more hungry and less full after a meal than the controls</p>
<h3 id="hypothalamic-regulation-of-eating-how-does-the-brain-control-eating">Hypothalamic regulation of eating: how does the brain control eating?</h3>
<p>tumours in the hypothalamus �/span&gt; <em>hyperphagia</em> (excessive overeating) and obesity</p>
<p><em>stereotaxic surgery</em> (1930s): could experiment with damage to particular areas of the hypothalamus to see the effect on eating behaviour of animals</p>
<p>Hetherington &amp; Ranson (1942): large, bilateral lesions in the ventral medial nucleus (VMN) of the hypothalamus (lower, central) �/span&gt; hyperphagia</p>
<p>VMH: assumed that its normal function is to inhibit feeding when the animal is �full�</p>
<p>= the <em>satiety centre</em> (found in rats, cats, dogs, chickens and monkeys (Teitelbaum, 1967) )</p>
<p>in fact it may be that it is the tendency to become obese that causes them to overeat</p>
<p>the lesions �/span&gt;</p>
<p>� the body�s tendency to produce fat (lipogenesis)</p>
<p>and � the tendency to release fats into the bloodstream (lipolysis)</p>
<p>so calories eaten are converted to fat very fast, and the animal has to keep eating to ensure that it has enough calories in the blood stream</p>
<p>VMH syndrome behavioural complications:</p>
<p>most animals will eat even bad-tasting food</p>
<p>hyperphagic rats will become underweight if quinine is added to their food � taste becomes very important (Teitelbaum, 1955)</p>
<p>VMH syndrome is also anatomically complex:</p>
<p>damage to VMN</p>
<p>but also to axons which connect the <em>paraventricular nucleus</em> (PVN) (situated in the medial hypothalamus) with parts of the brainstem</p>
<p>microinjections of CCK into the PVN inhibit food intake</p>
<p>microinjections of a supposed hunger peptide, <em>substance Y</em> �/span&gt; stimulates eating (Pinel, 1993)</p>
<p>2 neurotransmitters in the medial hypothalamus play an important role in eating behaviour:</p>
<p>noradrenaline stimulates carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>serotonin inhibits it</p>
<p>lateral hypothalamus (LH) accelerates eating</p>
<p>bilateral lesions to the LH � aphagia (refusal to eat, to the point of starvation) (Anand &amp; Brobeck, 1951; Teitelbaum &amp; Stellar, 1954)</p>
<p>even VMH lesioned rats �/span&gt; aphagic if LH lesioned</p>
<p>LH = <em>feeding centre</em></p>
<p>not well understood � diffuse effects</p>
<p>LH syndrome includes both aphagia and also adipsia (cessation of drinking)</p>
<p>both are part of a more general lack of responsiveness to sensory input</p>
<p>LH itself = large + ill-defined, many nuclei, several major nerve tracts through it</p>
<p>electrical stimulation of LH �/span&gt; eating, but also drinking, gnawing, temperature changes + sexual activity</p>
<p>electrical stimulation to other areas (of they hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and frontal cortex) also �/span&gt; eating</p>
<p>Pinel (1993) � LH �hunger centre� = misnomer</p>

<h2 id="questions_1">Questions</h2>
<p>surely the (phenomenological) hunger pangs are different to the homeostatic drive itself</p>
<p>what�s the system of digestion like?</p>
<p>if the stomach exit to the duodenum is blocked off, then how does the food ever get digested?</p>
<p>what form does the information from the GIT to brain take � vagus nerve???</p>
<p>is it neurally-encoded information about the state of the GIT, or is it that the brain can tell from what is absorbed in the blood as it circulates around the brain?</p>
<p>does our blood sugar level rise immediately upon eating? � otherwise, this causes problems for the glucostatic theory</p>
<p>no, it�s a post-absorptive effect (i.e. the last of the 4 processes in satiety)</p>
<p>also, there is a grey area between hunger and satiety � not a fine line/stimulus level</p>
<p>can there be a neural mechanism that calculates glucose utilisation?</p>
<p>do the rats with damage to the lateral hypothalamus actually starve to death?</p>
<p>no, it seems they only have a much lowered body weight set point</p>
<p>why is it called the lipostatic theory?</p>
<p>because it�s based around fat (lipids) and maintaining a body weight (fatness) set point</p>
<p>why do sensory effects come before cognitive effects?</p>
<p>stomach loading vs gastric distension</p>
<p>duodenum chemosensors</p>
<p>can you get sensory-specific satiety for a particular food, e.g. spaghetti bolognaise, or only for one of the main food taste types</p>
<p>VMN vs VMH</p>
<p>what�s the NTS?</p>
