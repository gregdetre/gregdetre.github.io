<h1>Does utilitarianism make unrealistic demands on our limited capacity for
knowledge?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Mill essay III</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:1.5pt;text-align:right'>Tuesday,
16 May, 2000</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:1.5pt;text-align:right'>Dr
Tasioulas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In its most basic form, utilitarianism directs every moral
agent to act so that the aggregate welfare of all moral agents is maximised. On
a first reading, we might be lulled into hoping that utilitarianism offers us a
means to elevate our world to the best of all possible worlds � who would argue
when faced with such a utopian vision? I think utilitarianism can be criticised
by two main lines: our limitations as moral agents are too crippling for us to
be able to abide by a utilitarian morality; and even if by superhuman effort
and miraculous understanding we were to overcome these limitations, our lives
in a utilitarian utopia would be lacking compared to a prudential life. Seen
the other way around: despite being a supposedly maximum-utility world, there
are other worlds I would actually rather live in; and a maximum or even high
utility world would not result from our overly-fallible attempts to follow the
utilitarian standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will focus largely on the issue of utilitarianism�s
unrealistic demands, since the question of utilitarianism�s desirability opens
every other question in ethics. Mill was aware of being criticised for
requiring too much of us in his morality. His answer was to dismiss this as
besides the point, since an ethical theory shows us what we ought to strive
for, irrespective of whether we want or are able to meet this aim. To an
extent, he is justified in this � no morality will be effortless, and we are in
a better position having a demanding criterion than none at all. Moreover,
because utilitarian rightness and wrongness are (non-mutually exclusive)
continua, not absolutes, utilitarianism is tolerant to error � we might not
always choose the best action, but if utilitarianism helps us act in a better
way than we otherwise would, it is valuable to us nevertheless. However, if a
moral theory is too demanding then there is a danger of our grossly misapplying
it, or that few will recognise its validity. A moral theory needs to coincide
roughly with, as well as refine, common sense ethics, which is predicated
firmly of our nature and limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griffin is right to stress our status as agents, and to
attack any objective ethical theory which is blind to our capacity to employ
it. He shows there to be four areas which delimit our moral agency:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The good life<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:1.5pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>There appears to be a conflict between
classical utilitarianism�s emphasis on maximising a relatively short-term
mental state, and the long-term, life-structuring, partial, non-utilitarian
prudential values, such as enjoyment, understanding, accomplishment, deep
personal relations, autonomy and liberty<span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The limits of the will<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>We are constrained (by evolution) in what we can will ourselves into
doing, and autonomy is an essential component of morality. Mill points to the
power of education and indoctrination, and history has shown the power of
inspiring goals such as religion in enabling us to transcend our capacities<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The demands of the social life<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

obligation-generating social, political and economic institutions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Our knowledge of both past and future
is fuzzy, subjective and narrow � constrained by memory, understanding,
situation, language, personality and point of view. Although, we supposedly
have the whole of human history as our guide to help in making complex
utilitarian calculations, our knowledge of that history is restricted to what
is available to us in writing, conversation or direct experience, and how much
of this we actually remember. When using this knowledge for predictive and
evaluative purposes, our appraisal of the current situation is necessarily
subjective and patchy, and our guesses about consequences can be misled by
insufficient, ignored or over-emphasised facts about the world, physics,
others� motivations or chance. At every stage, our decisions are coloured by
our interpretation of events and issues, past experience and unconscious
biases, what lessons we have learned and a maximum volume of information we can
absorb, process and imagine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>Given this outline of our capacities, we need to look at utilitarianism
and the demands it makes on us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the difficulties of discussing utilitarianism is that
it comes in many different flavours, each with its own particular demands and
appeal. We are only interested in evaluating the strongest form that
utilitarianism can take � by this, I mean the form which, if followed to the
best of our ability, would give rise to the world we would most want to live
in. By starting with the most demanding, and titrating down to a theory which
seems both workable and valuable, I hope to reach a compromise between our
limitations and utilitarianism�s elegance and appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Single-level act utilitarianism is probably the most basic
formulation of the utilitarian formula: an action is right insofar as it
increases the aggregate utility. Strictly then, we should consciously consider
to what extent our every action will affect the aggregate utility, requiring
one be entirely impartial and rational, and to act directly in line with this
calculation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consequentialism defines the right action as being the one
that gives rise to the best state of affairs. Extending single-level act
utilitarianism, we have welfarist consequentialism, perhaps the most demanding
and rational form of utilitarianism. Here, the right action is the one that
gives rise to the greatest total utility over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griffin gives various scenarios where one has the choice of
sacrificing one life to save many. In the most clear-cut, such as the fat
tourist trapping his five friends while the water level rises, a
consequentialist would see no intrinsic problem in dynamiting him out of the
hole to let the rest of them climb out. However, the example of the surgeon
considering transplanting the unwilling recluse�s body parts to save five other
patients demonstrates the power and fundamental impracticability of
consequentalism. It might be that no one would find out, in which case the
surgeon would have done the right thing. Or it might be that rumours of
surgeons illicitly �playing God� might surface if such actions became
commonplace, damaging the doctor-patient relationship and causing six fatal
heart-attacks in rich misers throughout the country. Or it might be that the
recluse did have a loving family in Australia, or that his generous donations
to charity dry up, or that one of those five patients is a serial killer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This brings up the question of how far to look ahead in our
evaluation of the endless ramifications of an action. Unless we intend to look
to a Judgement Day, there is no single, ultimate, eventual state of affairs to
evaluate against. Should we instead add up the aggregate over time, so that our
calculations of total utility extend not only to all other moral agents, but
also into the infinite future? But then, how can we be blamed (or lauded) if,
like the oblivious butterfly, our actions indirectly cause a tidal wave on the
other side of the globe, perhaps years in the future. Or need we only judge the
morality of an action by the consequences we can foresee? This is in line with
Sidgwick�s distinction between objective and subjective rightness, where a
decision based on the probability of good or bad likely to ensue might lead a
surgeon to opt for a less risky but less beneficial operation � this would be
the subjectively right thing to do, though he might in actuality be doing the
objectively wrong thing if (unbeknownst to him) the riskier operation would
have been successful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This seems to be only the first step away from our objective
utilitarianism, where actions are always right or wrong no matter who performs
them, towards a morality based on individual differences, where one person can
be said to have done the right thing but another should have known better.
Either way, such a limited consequentialism implicitly acknowledges that the
right action is no longer necessarily tied to a maximising of utility. However,
it is the only form of consequentialism that we can hope to apply, and indeed
is similar to our common-sense evaluation of responsibility consequences based
on intentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the opposite direction lie the rule utilitarians, who
emphasise Mill�s discussion of the place of customary morality in
utilitarianism. They seek to rest what seems like an objective list of values
on a utilitarian framework, by recognising the ultimate standard of utility
only to justify secondary principles, such as honesty, loyalty or health. This
has the disadvantage of distancing oneself from the appealing simplicity of the
principle of utility, as well as being open to all the criticisms of older
objective list ethical theories, such as �Which values should feature on your
list?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I do not intend to dwell on such rule worship forms of
utilitarianism because I think Mill�s own �multi-level� formulation (with which
it seems clear he deserves to be credited) wholly supercedes pure rule
utilitarianism. He explains the need for such a non-act utilitarian level of
customary morality as being a way to make act utilitarianism more practicable.
Rather than ponderously calculating the act utilitarian effects of our every
action, we can work on the basis of secondary principles, reliably based on the
experience of mankind over the ages, only resorting to our ultimate principle
of utility in situations of conflict. In this neat way, he reduces the demands
of time of calculation, as well as the demands of knowledge � we find it quite
manageable to decide our actions on the basis of a small number of moral
principles, such as those the rule utilitarians might favour. Then, when we
turn to ethics to provide direction in exceptional circumstances, we perform
the best act utilitarian calculation, and act in a subjectively right manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact, Mill further acknowledges that there is no
intrinsic status to these secondary principles by stating that philosophers
still have the job of refining them to ensure that they do result in maximising
utility in the widest possible range of circumstances, to make our job as moral
agents easier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our discussion seems to have highlighted two areas where we
find the demands that utilitarianism places upon us particularly heavy: our
partiality and ignorance. Certainly, Mill�s multi-level utilitarianism
alleviates the otherwise impossible burden on our knowledge, but it requires an
almost schizophrenic adherence to a customary morality with no intrinsic weight
- it leaves us in the position of living rule-based, partial lives on a
day-to-day basis, but having to set aside all familial loyalties, preferences
and friendships when faced with problematic conflicts in our secondary
principles. If there is an axe-murderer chasing my best friend, do I lie about
where my friend is hiding to protect him? Well, since there is a conflict here
between loyalty and honesty, we resort to the utilitarian principle. Mill�s
system seems to break down here, if for example, the axe-murderer would derive
enormous utility from using my best friend�s limbs as a hat rack, since a
utilitarian perspective might justify my telling him the truth about my
friend�s hiding place. The answer we would like our system to give seems to
highlight a problem with partiality deep in the utilitarian enterprise,
resolvable only with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>some sort of deontological
weighting (e.g. towards loyalty to friends) which we cannot justify.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having said this, utilitarianism is valuable even if it
helps us make good, but imperfect, choices. Paradoxically, we find ourselves
relying on the limitations of the human will regarding impartial benevolence to
ensure that I make the �right� (in an obviously non-utilitarian sense) choice
to save my friend. This highlights the possibility, however, that in applying a
principle which places demands far above our abilities and knowledge, we may
make very wrong choices indeed. This human frailty is why Mill offers us
customary morality. His multi-level view complicates utilitarianism, but it
does appear to make fairly realistic demands and give rise largely agreeable
action.</p>
