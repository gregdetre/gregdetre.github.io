<h2>Gallese &amp; Goldman, �Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of
mind-reading�, �Trends in cognitive sciences�, Dec 1998</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mirror neurons (MNs) fire both when the monkey sees an
action performed, and when it performs the same actions. They fail to respond
to just the sight of the object or of the agent alone, nor to mimicking the
action without the object or with tools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gallese and Goldmain claim that there�s good evidence to
suppose that a similar execution/observation matching system exists in humans.
I didn�t fully understand their description of Fadiga et al.�s Transcranic
Magnetic Stimulation study. It showed that while observing objects being
grasped, people�s motor evoked potentials in hand muscles increase during TMS.
As far as I can tell, they are arguing that this is because the TMS stimulates
the motor cortex, the MNs are responsible for increased activity in the
premotor cortex, and in conjunction these responses affect the MEPs in the hand
muscles. Two further PET studies have shown the left superior temporal sulcus
(Brodmann�s area 21), the left inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann�s area 40)
and the anterior part of Broca�s region (Brodmann�s area 45) to be particularly
activated when observing being grasped rather than just the objects. This is
one source of the argument for F5 being a homologue to Broca�s area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gallese &amp; Goldman argue against MNs� role in learning by
imitation, but instead as being implicated in mind-reading (aka �folk psychologising�),
the activity of representing specific mental states of others. They discuss the
difference between the theory theory and simulation theory of mind. Theory
theory considers that people mind-read by creating theoretical posits of
others� mental states in order to explain their behaviour, in the same sort of
way �that physicists appeal to electrons and quarks to predict and explain
observable phenomena�. The simulation theorists argue that humans� mind-reading
abilities are based on the ability to <i>simulate</i> the mental states of
others. In other words, we are able to predict or retrodict another person�s
mental states by putting ourselves in another�s shoes and simulating what
mental state we would be in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the brain is utilising the same machinery for making
one�s own decisions as for predicting/retrodicting others� mental states
offline (as per the simulation theory), then finding neurological evidence for
mental mimickry in the mind-reading process would support the ST over the TT.
They postulate that externally-generated activity in the MNs plays this
simulation role, or at least some primitive version of it in monkeys. They
consider Fadiga et al.�s TMS study to provide further support for the ST, since
it showed that downstream motor activity in the observer is facilitated by
observation of that motor activity in the target. This result is unexplained by
the TT, and implies that the simulation activity is not completely offline in
humans. That there exists a group of prefrontal-lesioned compulsive imitators
could be neatly explained by a lack of downstream inhibition of this
partially-online simulation process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If MNs are the neural correlate of a �cognitive continuity�
of intentional-state attribution, then we might expect that MNs in humans have
been coopted into doing something more complicated than they do in monkeys. I�m
not sure quite what this might be. I was surprised to find that all mention of
MNs focuses on hand- and mouth-related actions, so perhaps human MNs are able
to relate a wider range of body-parts at the action-level, as well as more
abstract motor programs at the program-level. After all, there is evidence that
when writing one�s signature, certain shape characteristics are retained even
when using one�s big toe, or when writing on the blackboard instead of a piece
of paper, even though fMRI studies indicate that the movement parameters are
stored in secondary sensorimotor cortices of the dominant hand (Rijntjies et
al. 1999).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to the theory theory vs simulation theory
debate, I had one major query. As I understand it, theory theorists are
claiming that the theoretical posits we produce about about other people�s
beliefs and desires are like scientific hypotheses to best explain the data of
their behaviour, without being produced by simulating what they themselves
would feel, believe, or desire in a similar position. If this was really the
case, then wouldn�t we occasionally expect the beliefs and desires that people
attribute to others to differ in kind from the beliefs and desires they
understand themselves to have? After all, the only reason that I attribute
beliefs and desires like mine to other people is because I assume that we are
fundamentally alike. If, in TT, the beliefs and desires are really only
theoretical posits, wouldn�t there be a propensity to imagine other people to
have strange and alien mental mechanisms generating their behaviour? If theory
theorists were to respond by saying that we have a kind of censor that
restricts our hypotheses to those akin to our own mental machinery, this makes
their theory more ugly, and more similar to simulation theory than they might
like to admit.</p>

<h2>Williams , Whiten, Suddendorf &amp; Perret, �Imitation, mirror neurons and
autism�, in �Neuroscience And Biobehavioral Reviews�, date unknown</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>They characterise the autistic spectrum disorders in terms
of impairments in social interaction, imaginative ability and repetitive and
restricted patterns of behaviour. Autism has an onset before 3 years and is
associated with delayed/abnormal language development. Baron-Cohen et al.
suggested that autism may result from a deficit or delay in development of
theory of mind. Williams et al. give three good reasons for thinking that this
cannot be quite the right or whole story:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list .5in'>Autistic
     disorders are manifested earlier than robust ToM develops in normal
     children, implying that there must be some precursors to ToM that manifest
     themselves as the onset of autism (e.g. pretend play, the capacity to
     engage in shared attention with another individual)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6;
     tab-stops:list .5in'>Early social deficits appear to be broader in scope
     than implied by the focus on ToM, e.g. a broad lack of empathic and
     emotional engagement with others.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo6;
     tab-stops:list .5in'>Other social and non-social problems associated with
     autism like repetitive/stereotyped behaviour, obsessive desire fors
     ameness, delayed and deviant language development and difficulties in
     perceiving or planning at high levels of organisation are less
     well-explained by impairment of ToM.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rogers and Pennington first suggested that deficits in
imitation might play this precursor role in the development of autism, and be
able to answer at least the first two of the above objections. They suggested
that the root of autism may be �impaired formation/co-ordination of specific
self-other representations� resulting from impaired imitation. After all,
intuition and the attribution of mental state both �involve translating from
the perspective of another individual to oneself�. The link between the two is
even closer for the simulation theory. We discussed Meltzoff and Gopnik�s
hypothesis that a new-born�s capacity for translating and imitating the seen
behaviour (facial expressions) of others might underlie emotional mind-reading.
Moreover, the 21 experimental studies of the imitative competence of individuals
with autism seem to provide fairly strong evidence of impairment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the paper revolves around the idea that MNs
could be neural correlates of our imitative abilities, and that their early
impairment might be related to the development of autism. This is evidenced by
the observation of imitative dyspraxia in patients with left frontal lobe
lesions, who are unable to repeat actions performed by others, or to replicate
the gestures on a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>mannequin. This makes
sense, given MNs� purported locations in left Broca�s area in humans (as well
as in the premotor and parietal cortex).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rizzolatti and Arbib have suggested that MNs may have
evolved to subserve speech in humans by building upon a prelinguistic grammar
of actions in the primate brain. Few details of how this might work are given
in this paper, but it seems a little implausible at first hearing. However,
vervets have a roughly 4-signal verbal vocabulary, and bonobos chatter amongst
each other in large groups for hours at a time. I would want to see how well
Rizzolatti &amp; Arbib�s suggestion fits with neural activity during these
kinds of pre-linguistic behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It�s fairly easy to see how MNs could be precursors to full
ToM, e.g. in retrodicting others� mental states by reconstituting an executive
plan to perform an action like the one being watched. Similarly, emotional
contagion and emotional mind-reading may be related (cf Meltzoff &amp; Gopnik).
Although Williams et al. mention that shared attention may also be crucial to
the development of a full ToM, the case for implicating MNs here is surely much
weaker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, some impairment or delay in the development of
(some of the) mirror neurons may be heavily implicated in autism. Failure to
develop self-other representations may result in failure to develop reciprocal
social abilities: e.g. shared/joint attention, gestural recognition, language
(especially social/pragmatic aspects), breakdowns in the development of
empathy/ToM. They explain the repetitive/inflexible/stereotyped behaviour as
something to do with perception-action linkage, and because the child may have
failed to learn some of their high-level executive functions (also apparently
impaired in autism) from others (program-level imitation). As I argued briefly
towards the end of the earlier critique, I�m open to the idea that MNs could
