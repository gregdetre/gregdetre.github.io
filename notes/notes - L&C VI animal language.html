<h3><a name="_Toc498902561">Introduction</a></h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>communication
= transmitting information that influences the listener�s behaviour</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>e.g.
friendship, id (mates + parents), aggression, ownership, hunger, lying</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>deaf
female turkey laid the eggs then killed the chicks � hearing their cries must
be somehow crucial in establishing that they were hers</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>why sound?
goes round corners and through things (anything except a vacuum) including
water, can be modulated rapidly + variously, can be heard at night, does not
leave a trace, works over long distances</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>can vary the
frequency (blackbirds), the amplitude or the temporal patterning</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>vocal
animals blow air through an appendage or across a membrane</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>instrumentalists
rub (appendages) or beat (what they�re standing on)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>e.g.
the mole cricket Gryllotalpa Vinaea builds a twin-megaphone burrow to amplify
its noise to 90dB (from a metre away), despite being only 5cm long</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>sound
communication probably evolved from non-signal movements which served a
different purpose. the change to a communication function = called <i>ritualisation</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>trilobites
500m years ago may have been the first to use their hard exoskeletons as
sound-making equipment</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902562">Humpback whales</a></h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the
worldwide population of humpback whales has gone down by 95% since the turn of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Roger +
Katy Payne built up a sound library of 20 years of whales at Bermuda</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>realised
that the humpback whales in a given breeding area (and all the others they
mingle with) sing the same constantly-evolving song (which the Paynes see in
themes, phrases + units)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>whales
have the largest brains of an animal ever</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>tempting
to think that they are wise and have complex mental lives, but are constrained
by their environment (i.e. their ability to manipulate it, e.g. through tool
use)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>it
could just be that their brains are because of the difficulties of the acoustic
processing necessary to hear the song as produced under water</p>

<p class=ShortReturnAddress>although bat brains are less than a gram</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they may dance in time, and the song may be related to
courtship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they sing alone, hundreds of miles apart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when a mother and calf are together, an escort swims to join
them</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>when
an escort got in between mother + calf in a threatening situation, the mother
gave it a half minute series of grunts � Tyack</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>aggressive
activity between 2 escort males � variety of slaps, bubbles, vocal social-sounding
calls, song segments, trumpeting and grunts � up to 15 other whales stream to
join, trying to jostle the principal escort</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>eventually
they drop away and lose interest and start singing again</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>when Tyack
and the US Navy used playback calls of the social calls, the singing whales
would home in on the loudspeaker at up to 12km/hr</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the song
could be a spacing mechanism for courting males?</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902563">Southern right whales</a></h3>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Peninsula
Valdes in Patagonia � very windy/stormy bays</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the
Southern right whales use flipper-slapping on the surface when the low
frequencies are masked by the storm</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Christopher
and Jane Clark (Rockefeller Uni) observed:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>in
the bay, low-frequency tonal calls for long-distance (100-300Hz = the quietest
frequency in the bay) � cease the calls when they meet up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they use higher frequency when excited or in tight active
groups</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aggressive growling between males</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when there is 1 male/1 female, they use higher melodic notes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>no alarm calls, despite the killer whales</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>this is
not complex communication, because they are grazers, not hunters, and don�t
require group coordination (as dolphins do). moreover, they are promiscuous
rather than monogamous, so they require fewer social calls.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>respond
only to southern right whale playback (not humpback/synthesised tones) � would
head straight for the loudspeaker immediately, making sounds themselves</p>

(Diamond 1993)</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902579">Sarah</a> </h3>

<p>In the year after Project Washoe began, David Premack started an experiment
with a different kind of language. The above-mentioned plastic tokens are those
which Premack used to train a chimpanzee named Sarah. These tokens represented
words, and varied in shape, size, texture, and colour. Sentences were formed by
placing the tokens in a vertical line (an orientation which Sarah favoured).
This language differs from sign language in that &quot;the permanence of the
sentence not only makes it possible to study language without a memory problem,
but to study memory in the context of language by regulating the duration for
which the sentence remains on the board&quot; (D. Premack 1979: 233). Sarah was
taught nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and quantifiers; she was also taught
same-difference, negation, and compound sentences. The earliest words named
&quot;various interesting fruits, so that Sarah ... could both solve her
problem and <b>eat </b>it&quot; (A. Premack 1976: 79). Sarah exhibited
displacement, the ability to think of something (in the following case,
chocolate) when it is not immediately present. Presented with the sentence
&quot;Brown color of chocolate&quot; without any chocolate present, and later
presented with &quot;Take brown,&quot; Sarah took a brown object (A. Premack
1976: 89). When a trainer put a question on Sarah's board and walked away,
Sarah showed little interest in answering it--&quot;in somewhat the way a
conversation falters when one person ceases to pay attention to the other&quot;
(D. Premack 1971: 821). To show that Sarah was not merely responding to cues
from her human trainers, she was adapted to a new trainer that did not know her
language. When this trainer presented her with questions, she gave the correct
answers less frequently than usual, but still well above chance. Ann Premack
remarked that &quot;it would be interesting to see how well a child at this
language stage of about 150 words would do in a simple language test with a
virtual stranger&quot; (A. Premack 1976: 103). To test Sarah's view of words,
Premack presented her with an apple and a set of features (for example, round
vs. square and red vs. green). Then she was presented with her <b>word </b>for
apple, and the same set of features. She choose the correct features for both
the real apple and her word for apple, a light-blue plastic triangle (A.
Premack 1976: 104). This demonstrates Hockett's property of arbitrariness; the
symbol for apple is arbitrary (that is, there is no similarity between an apple
and a light-blue plastic triangle).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902580">Other Ape Language Experiments: Sherman &amp;
Austin, Chantek, Kanzi, Koko</a> </h3>

<p>Many other ape language experiments were done other than the four described
above; I will briefly list several of these. Sherman and Austin were two chimpanzees
who were able to communicate specific information to each other through the use
of symbols, information that they could not communicate without the symbols
(Savage-Rumbaugh, Rumbaugh &amp; Boysen: 1978). Chantek, an orangutan, learned
about 150 different signs, and used them spontaneously and without undue
repetition. Chantek internalized a minimal value system, using signs for GOOD<b>
</b>and BAD<b> </b>in appropriate contexts (Miles 1993: 47, 52). A bonobo named
Kanzi learned at a faster rate than the chimpanzees; he learned his first words
by merely watching lessons directed at his mother. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
describes Kanzi as &quot;the ape at the brink of the human mind&quot; in her
book of that title. John Mitani summarizes the book in his <a
href="http://envirolink.org/arrs/essays/kanzi_review.html">review</a>.
Savage-Rumbaugh asserts that Kanzi uses sentences; that is, he follows
structured rules in his multi-word utterances (showing the property of
duality). He even makes up his own rules, such as first using a lexigram to
specify an action and then using a gesture to specify an agent (Savage-Rumbaugh
&amp; Lewin: 1994: 161). Francine Patterson has been raising <a
href="http://www.gorilla.org/">Koko, a gorilla</a>, since 1972 and teaching her
sign language. Koko has learned a greater vocabulary than Nim, uses more words
per utterance on average, and &quot;a great deal of creativity, spontaneity,
and structure characterize her utterances&quot; (Patterson &amp; Linden
1981:116). Koko also rhymes and jokes; on one occasion she used a metaphor of
an elephant to refer to herself when she pretended a long tube was her
&quot;trunk&quot; (Patterson &amp; Linden 1981: 143). These characteristics of
Koko's utterances show the property of productivity, in which a speaker says
something never heard or said before and is understood by the audience. (It is
interesting how one automatically uses the language of speech when describing
any form of language use, including those which are not spoken. Many of my
sources also exhibit this trait.) The <b>Nova</b> program <a

of exploring the various experiments and issues involved in ape language.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902581">Notes � on Hockett�s Linguistic Universals</a></h2>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>A more elaborate way of defining
language was proposed by Charles F. Hockett, a contemporary of Chomsky's who
was &quot;unceremoniously eclipsed&quot; by Chomsky &quot;sprang[ing] to
fame&quot; after the introduction of his transformational model of grammar
(Seuren 1998:215). Some of his thirteen criteria (Crystal 1997:400-401) relate directly
to spoken communication. The only ability resembling speech is the ability to
use vocalizations which do, of course, entail an <i>auditory-vocal channel</i>
with <i>broadcast transmission and directional reception</i> of discrete,
contrasting sounds (<i>discreteness</i>, cp. supra on vervet calls) and <i>rapid
fading</i> � i.e. transitoriness of auditory signals (cp. Hockett's application
of his features to gibbon calls in Crystal 1997:401 after Hockett 1960:10-11).
Incidentally, the signs of sign language are equally transitory. Hockett even
sees <i>total feedback</i> in gibbon calls (and hence, in ape vocalizations),
as they allow for &quot;speakers [to] hear and [�] reflect upon everything that
they 'say' &quot; (Crystal 1997:401; added quotation marks ours). </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>Hockett called the ability to send
and receive messages �<i>interchangeability�</i>. It is clear that all the
primates used in recent research projects were able to both understand the
signs of their caretakers and send out signs (whether using ASL or lexigrams
and gestures). A number of apes also displayed the ability to sign or
communicate not only when addressed; they would spontaneously report or ask
something to their caretakers. This demonstrates once more the feature of total
feedback:<i> </i>the primates can reflect upon everything they communicate.
Chantek, for instance, showed an ability to rephrase or improve the
articulation of a sign. In addition, the only function of the signs is to
convey meaning, they do not have a biological or any other function other than
signalling a meaning; Hockett calls this <i>specialization.</i> </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>The lexigrams which
Savage-Rumbaugh�s subjects used to communicate demonstrate that the non-human
primate language shows a high degree of <i>arbitrariness</i>, which is another
key feature in Hockett�s description of language. The geometrical symbols on
the keyboard, which were used to denote words like e.g. banana or toilet, show
no resemblance to the actual concept referred to. It will also be remembered
that Kanzi's invented rule for combining gestures with lexigrams is entirely arbitrary
(in the sense of 'not functionally motivated'). Furthermore, the symbols
&quot;convey meaning through their stable association with realworld
situations&quot; (ibid.); they show a degree of <i>semanticity.</i> </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'><i>Displacement</i>, or the ability
to talk about phenomena that are absent, is one of Hockett�s most important
criteria; especially deception is rated as the ultimate achievement of
discourse ability. Both Koko and Chantek displayed a kind of �Machiavellian
intelligence� and even their caretakers estimated that the apes lied an average
of three times per week. Furthermore, Chantek often signed about things or
places that were not present at the time and Patterson recorded numerous
instances where Koko signed about past events. Similar (and more extensively
documented) remarks clearly hold for Kanzi and other apes at the Language
Research Center. </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>Another important characteristic of
language is said to be the <i>productivity </i>of its users. As mentioned
above, Kanzi's &quot;language&quot; meets this requirement. In addition, some primates
showed that they were able to express a new concept, for which they had not yet
learned a word, by using old elements of their 'language'. Koko famously called
a mask an �eye-hat�, whereas Chantek called contact lens solution �eye drink�.
This proves that the primates did not use their signs in a limited or fixed
way. </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>Loulis, a chimpanzee who did not
really respond to the training she underwent, showed yet another important
property of language. Whilst prolonged training proved unsuccessful, she did
manage to pick up over 50 signs spontaneously from other signing chimpanzees.
Hockett called this <i>traditional transmission</i>, or the ability to learn
language from the other language users. Similarly, Kanzi appears to have
learned at least one symbol from another ape (viz. Austin): the motorically
quite demanding handclapping gesture signifying &quot;chase&quot;
(Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1998:35-36). </span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>Displacement, productivity and
traditional transmission were not to be found in gibbon calls, according to
Hockett, nor was his final criterion of <i>duality of patterning</i>: &quot;The
sounds of language have no intrinsic meaning, but combine in different ways to
form elements (such as words) that do convey meaning (unlike animal calls,
which cannot be analyzed into two such levels of structure)&quot; (Crystal
1997:401). This criterion does not seem to apply to the signs of ASL nor to
lexigrams. </span></p>

<h2><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc498902581'>Notes � Jerry H. Gill, ch 1, �If a
Chimpanzee Could Talk�</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The point of Ludwig Wittgenstein's remark &quot;If a lion
could talk, we could not understand him&quot; <i>(Philosophical Investigations,</i>
p. 223) was to call attention to the fact that linguistic meaning is woven into
the very fabric of the human-way-of-being in the world, into what Wittgenstein
called &quot;the human form of life.&quot; Since lions do not participate in
this form of life, we presumably would not know how to take or what to do with
their utterances.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902582">Notes - Scientific American article, �Interview
with a parrot�</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>For months, I have been
waiting to meet Alex, the celebrity African gray parrot who has given new
meaning to the epithet &quot;birdbrain.&quot; Trained by Irene M. Pepperberg of
the University of Arizona, Alex may be the only nonhuman who speaks English and
means what he says. The 20-year-old bird is said to count up to six and to
recognize and name some 100 different objects, along with their color, texture
and shape; his ability to categorize rivals that of chimpanzees.</p>

<p>Walking into Pepperberg's small laboratory with a friend, I am stopped short
by a furious barrage of wolf whistles. Flustered, I locate the source as a
medium-size gray bird with a knowing eye, standing on a table littered with
fruit and paper fragments. &quot;Alex likes tall men,&quot; explains
Pepperberg, indicating my companion. Within minutes Alex is perched on his
shoulder, shivering, fluttering and hopping from foot to foot with excitement.
&quot;If he really likes you,&quot; a student warns, &quot;he'll throw up into
your ear&quot;--referring to a parrot's instinct for regurgitating food and
stuffing it into a mate. &quot;You wanna grape?&quot; Alex suddenly asks his
new consort in a nasal but perfectly clear voice. I am transfixed with
awe--until Pepperberg explains that Alex occasionally uses phrases without
meaning them. </p>

<p>Sometimes he does mean them. Ill at ease on my hand, Alex squawks,
&quot;Wanna go back,&quot; and climbs onto the back of a chair. Watching the
transactions are two other African grays--Kyaaro, a nervous bird that
Pepperberg likens to a child with attention-deficit disorder, and Griffin, a
fluffy, wide-eyed six-month-old. It is mealtime, and while Kyaaro sips his
coffee--which, I am told, helps to calm him down--Griffin is being coaxed with
bits of banana. &quot;Bread,&quot; announces Alex, and, being handed a piece of
muffin, proceeds to eat carefully around the blueberries. </p>

<p>My friend leaves so that Alex can concentrate, and we get to work. &quot;How
many?&quot; asks a student, displaying a tray with four corks. But Alex is in
an ornery mood and will not look. &quot;Two,&quot; he says quickly; then,
&quot;Cork nut&quot;--his designation for an almond, his reward. </p>

<p>&quot;That's wrong, Alex. No cork nut. How many?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Four,&quot; Alex replies. &quot;Four,&quot; echoes Kyaaro melodically
from across the room. Griffin, on my shoulder, pulls out my hairpins while I
try to take notes. &quot;You weren't looking,&quot; the student sighs and
fetches a metal key and a green plastic one. &quot;What toy?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Key.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;How many?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Two.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What's different?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Color.&quot; </p>

<p>This time Alex gets his cork nut. While he nibbles, Griffin hops off to
steal the rest of Alex's food, and I take out my camera. Instantly, Alex puffs
out his feathers--or what is left of them, given that he has pulled out most of
his tail--and straightens up. I have to put the device away before he can get
back to work. Alex goes on to identify a stone as &quot;rock,&quot; a square as
&quot;four corner,&quot; the letters &quot;O&quot; and &quot;R&quot; placed
together as &quot;OR&quot; and eventually to request in a small, sad voice,
&quot;Cork nut.&quot; </p>

<p>Pepperberg teaches her parrots by using a threesome--herself, the bird and a
student. One person holds up an object; the other names and then receives it.
Listening, watching and practicing, the bird learns the word that will get him
the new toy. These days Alex often substitutes for a human in teaching the
younger birds. He rarely makes mistakes when in this role, and Kyaaro and
Griffin learn faster from him than from humans. </p>

<p>For a long time, scientists believed that birds, with their small brains,
were capable of no more than mindless mimicry or simple association. But
Pepperberg has shown that Alex, at least, can use language creatively--and also
reason with a complexity comparable to that demonstrated in nonhuman primates
or cetaceans. Next, Pepperberg hopes to teach Alex that symbols such as
&quot;3&quot; refer to a particular number of objects. </p>

<p>My friend returns, and Alex is distracted again. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he
says after a particularly poor session. &quot;Wanna go back.&quot; It is time
to leave. The parting is eased by the arrival of a tall male student. My last
glimpse of the astonishing Alex reveals a scruffy gray bird dancing in ecstasy
on a man's shoulder. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902583">Notes - New York Times article, 6 June 1995, � Chimp
Talk Debate: Is It Really Language?� by George Johnson</a> </h2>

<p>PANBANISHA, a Bonobo chimpanzee who has become something of a star among
animal language researchers, was strolling through the Georgia woods with a
group of her fellow primates -- scientists at the Language Research Center at
Georgia State University in Atlanta. Suddenly, the chimp pulled one of them
aside. Grabbing a special keyboard of the kind used to teach severely retarded
children to communicate, she repeatedly pressed three symbols -- &quot;Fight,&quot;
&quot;Mad,&quot; &quot;Austin&quot; -- in various combinations. </p>

<p>Austin is the name of another chimpanzee at the center. Dr. Sue
Savage-Rumbaugh, one of Panbanisha's trainers, asked, &quot;Was there a fight
at Austin's house?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Waa, waa, waa&quot; said the chimpanzee, in what Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh
took as a sign of affirmation. She rushed to the building where Austin lives
and learned that earlier in the day two of the chimps there, a mother and her
son, had fought over which got to play with a computer and joystick used as
part of the training program. The son had bitten his mother, causing a ruckus
that, Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh surmised, had been overheard by Panbanisha, who lived
in another building about 200 feet away. As Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh saw it,
Panbanisha had a secret she urgently wanted to tell. </p>

<p>A decade and a half after the claims of animal language researchers were
discredited as exaggerated self-delusions, Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh is reporting
that her chimpanzees can demonstrate the rudimentary comprehension skills of 2
1/2-year-old children. According to a series of recent papers, the Bonobo, or
pygmy, chimps, which some scientists believe are more humanlike and intelligent
than the common chimpanzees studied in the earlier, flawed experiments, have
learned to understand complex sentences and use symbolic language to
communicate spontaneously with the outside world. </p>

<p>&quot;She had never put those three lexigrams together,&quot; Dr.
Savage-Rumbaugh said, referring to the keyboard symbols with which the animals
are trained. She found the incident, which occurred last month, particularly
gratifying because the chimp seemed to be using the symbols not to demand food,
which is usually the case in these experiments, but to gossip. </p>

<p>In a book to be published later this year, &quot;Apes, Language and the
Human Mind: Philosophical Primatology&quot; (Routledge), Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh
and her co-authors, Dr. Stuart Shanker, a philosopher at York University in
Toronto, and Dr. Talbot Taylor, a linguist at the College of William and Mary
in Virginia, argue that the feats of the chimps at the Language Research Center
are so impressive that scientists must now re-evaluate some of their most basic
ideas about the nature of language. </p>

<p>Most language experts dismiss experiments like the ones with Panbanisha as
exercises in wishful thinking. &quot;In my mind this kind of research is more
analogous to the bears in the Moscow circus who are trained to ride
unicycles,&quot; said Dr. Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies language acquisition in
children. &quot;You can train animals to do all kinds of amazing things.&quot;
He is not convinced that the chimps have learned anything more sophisticated
than how to press the right buttons in order to get the hairless apes on the
other side of the console to cough up M &amp; M's, bananas and other tidbits of
food. </p>

<p>Dr. Noam Chomsky, the M.I.T. linguist whose theory that language is innate
and unique to people forms the infrastructure of the field, says that
attempting to teach linguistic skills to animals is irrational -- like trying
to teach people to flap their arms and fly. </p>

<p>&quot;Humans can fly about 30 feet -- that's what they do in the
Olympics,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;Is that flying? The question is
totally meaningless. In fact the analogy to flying is misleading because when
humans fly 30 feet, the organs they're using are kind of homologous to the ones
that chickens and eagles use.&quot; Arms and wings, in other words, arise from
the same branch of the evolutionary tree. &quot;Whatever the chimps are doing
is not even homologous as far as we know,&quot; he said. There is no evidence
that the chimpanzee utterances emerge from anything like the &quot;language
organ&quot; Dr. Chomsky believes resides only in human brains. This neural
wiring is said to be the source of the universal grammar that unites all
languages. </p>

<p>But some philosophers, like Dr. Shanker, complain that the linguists are
applying a double standard: they dismiss skills -- like putting together a noun
and a verb to form a two-word sentence -- that they consider nascent linguistic
abilities in a very young child. </p>

<p>&quot;The linguists kept upping their demands and Sue kept meeting the
demands,&quot; said Dr. Shanker. &quot;But the linguists keep moving the goal
post.&quot; </p>

<p>Following Dr. Chomsky, most linguists argue that special neural circuitry
needed for language evolved after man's ancestors split from those of the
chimps millions of years ago. As evidence they note how quickly children,
unlike chimpanzees, go from cobbling together two-word utterances to
effortlessly spinning out complex sentences with phrases embedded within
phrases like Russian dolls. But Dr. Shanker and his colleagues insist that Dr.
Savage-Rumbaugh's experiments suggest that there is not an unbridgeable divide
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom, as orthodox linguists
believe, but rather a gradation of linguistic skills. </p>

<p>In a forthcoming book, &quot;The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul: A
Philosophical Journey Into the Brain&quot; (M. I. T. Press), Dr. Paul
Churchland, a philosopher and cognitive scientist at the University of
California at San Diego, says linguists should take Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh's
experiments as a challenge. He argues that the jury is still out: the rules for
constructing sentences might turn out to be not so much hard-wired as a result of
learning -- by people and potentially by their chimpanzee relatives. </p>

<p>Animal language research fell into disrepute in the late 1970's when
&quot;talking&quot; chimps like Washoe and the provocatively named Nim Chimpsky
were exposed as unintentional frauds. Because chimpanzees lack the vocal
apparatus to make a variety of modulated sounds, the animals were taught a
vocabulary of hand signs -- an approach first suggested in the 18th century by
the French physician Julien Offray de La Mettrie. In appearances on television
talk shows, trainers claimed the chimps could construct sentences of several
words. But upon closer examination, scientists found strong evidence that the
chimps had simply learned to please their teachers by contorting their hands
into all kinds of configurations. And the trainers, straining to find examples
of linguistic communication, thought they saw words among the wiggling, like
children seeing pictures in the clouds. </p>

<p>In a widely quoted paper in the journal Science, &quot;Can an Ape Create a
Sentence?&quot; Nim Chimpsky's trainer, Dr. Herbert Terrace, a Columbia
University psychologist, reluctantly concluded that the answer was no. </p>

<p>A chimp might learn to connect a hand sign with an item of food, skeptics
like Dr. Terrace argued, but this could be a matter of simple conditioning,
like Pavlov's dogs learning to salivate at the sound of a bell. Most
importantly, there was no evidence that the chimps had acquired a generative
grammar -- the ability to string words together into sentences of arbitrary
length and complexity. </p>

<p>As a young veteran of the original animal language experiments, Dr.
Savage-Rumbaugh decided to try a different approach. To eliminate the ambiguity
of hand signs, she used a keyboard with dozens of buttons marked with geometric
symbols. </p>

<p>In elaborate exercises beginning in the mid 1970's, she and her colleagues
taught common chimpanzees and bonobos to associate symbols with a variety of
things, people and places in and around the laboratory. The smartest chimps
even seemed to learn abstract categories, identifying pictures of objects as
either tools or food. Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh reported that two of the chimps
learned to use symbols to communicate with each other. Pecking away at the
keyboard, one would tell a companion where to find a key that would liberate a
banana for them both to share. </p>

<p>Most impressive of all was a bonobo named Kanzi. After futilely trying to
train Kanzi's adopted mother to use the keyboard, the researchers found that
the 2 1/2-year-old chimp, who apparently had been eavesdropping all along, had
picked up an impressive vocabulary on his own. Kanzi was taught not in
laboriously structured training sessions but on walks through the 50 acres of
forest surrounding the language center. By the time he was 6 years old, Kanzi
had acquired a vocabulary of 200 symbols and was constructing what might be
taken as rudimentary sentences consisting of a word combined with a gesture or
occasionally of two or three words. Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh became convinced that
exposure to language must start early and that the lessons should be driven by
the animal's curiosity. </p>

<p>Compared with other chimps, Kanzi's utterances are striking, but they are
still far from human abilities. Kanzi is much better at responding to vocal
commands like &quot;Take off Sue's shoe.&quot; In one particularly arresting
feat, recorded on videotape, Kanzi was told, &quot;Give the dog a shot.&quot;
The chimpanzee picked up a hypodermic syringe lying on the ground in front of
him, pulled off the cap and injected a toy stuffed dog. </p>

<p>Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh's critics say there is nothing surprising about
chimpanzees or even dogs and parrots associating vocal sounds with objects.
Kanzi has been trained to associate the sound &quot;dog&quot; with the furry
thing in front of him and has been programmed to carry out a stylized routine
when he hears &quot;shot.&quot; But does the chimp really understand what he is
doing? </p>

<p>Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh insists that experiments using words in novel contexts
show that the chimps are not just responding to sounds in a knee-jerk manner.
It is true, she says, that Kanzi was initially aided by vocal inflections, hand
gestures, facial expressions and other contextual clues. But once it had
mastered a vocabulary, the bonobo could properly respond to 70 percent of
unfamiliar sentences spoken by a trainer whose face was concealed. </p>

<p>None of this is very persuasive to linguists for whom the acid test of
language is not comprehension but performance, the ability to use grammar to
generate ever more complex sentences. </p>

<p>Dr. Terrace says Kanzi, like the disappointing Nim Chimpsky, is simply
&quot;going through a bag of tricks in order to get things.&quot; He is not
impressed by comparisons to human children. &quot;If a child did exactly what
the best chimpanzee did, the child would be thought of as disturbed,&quot; Dr.
Terrace said. </p>

<p>The scientists at the Language Research Center are &quot;studying some very
complicated cognitive processes in chimpanzees,&quot; Dr. Terrace said.
&quot;That says an awful lot about the evolution of intelligence. How do
chimpanzees think without language, how do they remember without language?
Those are much more important questions than trying to reproduce a few tidbits
of language from a chimpanzee trying to get rewards.&quot; </p>

<p>Attempting to shift the fulcrum of the debate over performance versus
comprehension, Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh argues that the linguists have things
backward: &quot;Comprehension is the route into language,&quot; she says. In
her view it is easier to take an idea already in one's mind and translate it
into a grammatical string of words than to decipher a sentence spoken by
another whose intentions are unknown. </p>

<p>Dr. Shanker, the York University philosopher, believes that the linguists'
objections reveal a naive view of how language works. When Kanzi gives the dog
a shot, he might well be relying on all kinds of contextual clues and subtle
gestures from the speaker, but that, Dr. Shanker argues, is what people do all
the time. </p>

<p>Following the ideas of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, he argues that
language is not just a matter of encoding and decoding strings of arbitrary
symbols. It is a social act that is always embedded in a situation. </p>

<p>But trotting out Wittgenstein and his often obscure philosophy is a way of
sending many linguists bolting for the exits. &quot;If higher apes were
incapable of anything beyond the trivialities that have been shown in these
experiments, they would have been extinct millions of years ago,&quot; Dr.
Chomsky said. &quot;If you want to find out about an organism you study what
it's good at. If you want to study humans you study language. If you want to
study pigeons you study their homing instinct. Every biologist knows this. This
research is just some kind of fanaticism.&quot; </p>

<p>There is a suspicion among some linguists and cognitive scientists that
animal language experiments are motivated as much by ideological as scientific
concerns -- by the conviction that intelligent behavior is not hard-wired but
learnable, by the desire to knock people off their self-appointed thrones and
champion the rights of downtrodden animals. </p>

<p>&quot;I know what it's like,&quot; Dr. Terrace said. &quot;I was once stung
by the same bug. I really wanted to communicate with a chimpanzee and find out
what the world looks like from a chimpanzee's point of view.&quot; </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902584">Washoe &amp; Loulis</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Allen and Beatrice Gardner began teaching sign language to
an infant chimpanzee named Washoe in 1966. The Gardners provided Washoe with a
friendly environment that they thought would be more conducive to learning. The
people who cared for and taught Washoe used sign language almost exclusively in
her presence. Washoe learned signs by various methods, including imitation and
instrumental conditioning. Washoe was able to transfer her signs spontaneously
to a new member of a class of referents; for example, she used the word
&quot;more&quot; in a wide variety of contexts (not just for more tickling,
which was the first referent) (Gardner &amp; Gardner 1979: 190). The Gardners
noted that &quot;Washoe has transferred the DOG sign to the sound of barking by
an unseen dog&quot; (191). They also reported that Washoe began to use
combinations of signs spontaneously after learning only about eight or ten of
them. The Gardners soon extended their experiments to several other
chimpanzees: Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar. They needed to replicate their success
with Washoe, and they did. All of these chimpanzees &quot;signed to friends and
to strangers. They signed to each other and to themselves, to dogs and to cats,
toys, tools, even to trees&quot; (Gardner &amp; Gardner 1989: 24). Private
signing by the chimpanzees has recently been studied systematically; the study
confirmed that private signing is robust (Bodamer, Fouts, Fouts &amp; Jensvold
1994). One of the most remarkable developments in this research occurred when
Washoe adopted an infant named Loulis. For the next five years, no sign
language was used by humans in Loulis' presence; however, Loulis still managed
to learn over 50 signs from the other chimpanzees. Bob Ingersoll, who studied
Washoe and Loulis during this time, believes that there wasn't much active
teaching going on, but rather Loulis picked up the signs from the other apes'
use of them. The learning of signs from other chimpanzees meets Hockett's
criterium of cultural transmission. Because the chimpanzees continued to use
sign language without any input from humans, the Gardners concluded that
&quot;once introduced, sign language is robust and self-supporting, unlike the
systems that depend on special apparatuses such as the Rumbaugh keyboards or
the Premack plastic tokens&quot; (Gardner &amp; Gardner 1989: 25).</p>

</span>[voice-over] Altogether, the Gardners collected more than 20 years of
data. Their research covered all aspects of chimp development, but it was the
experiments in sign language which caught the imagination of scientists and
public alike. For the first time, an ape was using human language, as these
films clearly showed. But instead of sealing the ape language debate, these
images were to become the focus for a bitter dispute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this sequence from 1974, Washoe is shown a baby doll
inside a cup. The camera seems to capture clear evidence of a chimpanzee
sentence, `Baby in my drink.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR: Treating a young ape as a human child is natural
enough, but extending all the trappings of human culture to adult apes presents
a number of practical problems. The chimps hand-reared by the Gardners over 20
years ago now live at Central Washington University, under the care of Roger
and Debbi Fouts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DEBBI FOUTS, Central Washington University:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>They have four rooms and five tunnels, and
it could be deadly boring, but instead, we try to make each day a unique,
interesting day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] These five chimps lived as a social group in temporary
accommodations on the third floor of the psychology building. This is Washoe,
the chimp who, 25 years ago, learned sign language in Reno. She and the other
Gardner chimps still communicate with the researchers in sign language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. FOUTS:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>During
the day they have any manner of things to play with. They have buckets of
Kool-Aid with hoses for straws. They can dip for yogurt. They have dress-up
clothes. They have brushes, toothbrushes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[to chimp] You want what? You want a toothbrush?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Ape language researchers now believe that once a chimp has
become accustomed to a rich human environment, it would be a cruel deprivation
to lose it. These adult chimps could live for another 30 years or more. They'll
require constant human care and attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RESEARCH ASSISTANT:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>They have a lunchtime meal that is served to them. They- if they would
like some more - it's usually a vegetable kind of a soup that has protein in it
- they ask for more soup, and then they're served more soup. We don't ever just
throw bowls in. We don't necessarily spoonfeed them. They are offered spoons
and dishes to eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] English is spoken here, but sign language still
predominates between chimp and human. Debbi Fouts has published work describing
the signing between the chimps when no one else is present. Students have
observed how signs are used by the chimps to initiate conversations. Before she
was brought here, Washoe had already given birth to two infants, neither of
whom lived beyond a few weeks. The second baby died after being taken away from
her for medical treatment. It was Roger Fouts's job to make Washoe understand
what had happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ROGER FOUTS, Central Washington University:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>I had to go back the next morning, and she
was very depressed, of course, and quite, quite alone, not signing with anybody.
And so I went in, and she came up to me, her eyes lit up. She came up to me and
she said, `Baby, holding, holding.' And it was a question, she was saying,
basically, `Where's my baby?' And I had to tell her, I said, `He's dead. He's
finished.' And with that, the baby sign literally dropped into her lap, her
head dropped, and she moved away into the corner and stopped signing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we searched and searched and searched, and 10 days after
his death, we finally found a replacement. It was Loulis [sp?], he was 10
months old. The next morning I went in and I signed, `Have baby.' And she
immediately started signing, `Baby, baby,' getting very excited, `Baby, baby,
baby, baby, baby,' slapping her hands, bipedal, hair up, extreme excitement.
And then when she signed, `My baby,' I knew we were in trouble. I knew she
misunderstood me. So I went out and got him, 10-month-old, he was on my chest,
came in, and then went in the enclosure with her, and when I got about maybe
two or three feet away she got a good look at him. And all this time she's
signing, `Baby, baby, baby, baby,' and she gets a good look at him and she just
sits down. And then she looks back up, and the she signs, `Baby.' Obviously,
she'd realized it wasn't her baby any longer, it was a strange baby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night she tried to sleep with him like her own baby.
She always took her to bed with her and slept with her, and so on, and slept
with him. She tried to do that with Loulis, too, and he would have nothing to
do with it. He laid down on his own end of the bench, and when she'd come he'd
move, until finally she let him. And then, at 4:00 in the morning, she woke up,
went into a bipedal swagger, banged the enclosure and signed, `Come, hug,'
slapping her hands, making a loud noise, and with that he jumped up out of a
sound sleep and leapt into the nearest hairy arms that were available, which
were hers, and she literally engulfed him and lay back down. And from that
moment on, they were inseparable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[to chimp] Washoe, Washoe, hey, hey, what's this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] From the time Loulis arrived, the researchers deliberately
restricted their signing to Washoe, to test whether or not Loulis would learn
sign language without human intervention. By the time he was five, they
reported that Loulis had learned a total of 51 signs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. FOUTS:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Loulis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] In May, 1993, the chimps were finally moved out of the
psychology building into a new specially designed home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. FOUTS;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>If you
want good research, you have to have proper care. You owe them that, at least.
They're not volunteers, they don't want to do this. We're still at the notion
of treating them like a hairy test tube, and that's an abomination. They are
not hairy test tubes. They are thinking, feeling, emotional beings with wants, desires
in a life, just like we do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] As this research proceeds, it could have some powerful
implications. If chimpanzees show they can acquire human language, use it to
communicate, and manipulate abstract symbols like words and numbers, then the
possibility is that chimp and human minds have a great deal more in common than
we thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. GARDNER:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
uses and misuses to which we put animals certainly have to do with lines that
we draw differentiating ourselves from them. I'm certain that even within human
populations, when we behave in a way that is not humanitarian, it is because we
draw a distinction. `If these people are not like me, they don't have the same
rights.' By drawing a continuity, I think we behave in a more human fashion to
all concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. GARDNER:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
reason why this research has become so controversial is that it's part of a
very long battle, not the battle over whether human beings are descended from
chimpanzees, but the battle over whether the same laws of nature apply to mice
and leopards and chimpanzees and human beings. Most of the history of modern
science has been a retreat from the notion of human speciality, and people more
or less have accepted this now about blood and bone, but behavior, emotion,
cognition, that's very hard. You can see the history of science of behavior as
a slow, retreating battle with separatists drawing the wagons in an
ever-tightening circle. And right now the last great stand seems to be made
over language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>If we take seriously the fact that the chimpanzee has an understanding
of language and an ability to produce language, it raises all kinds of other
questions. Are they conscious? How should we treat them? Are they rational?
Should they have chimpanzee rights? And we're not prepared to answer all of
these questions. We don't really know.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902585">Nim</a></h2>

<p>Herbert S. Terrace was skeptical of the reported success of the chimpanzees
Washoe, Sarah, and Lana. He believed that there were simpler explanations for
many of the reported interpretations of these apes' language use. Although
Terrace admitted that the apes had achieved something significant, he compared
their behaviour to that of pigeons who are taught to peck different colours in
a certain order (Terrace 1979: 20). He also believed that the apes used signs
only to receive rewards from their human trainers. When Terrace set up his own
experiment with the chimpanzee Nim, &quot;Nim's main reward for learning to
sign was our approval and being able to sign about something that was important
to him&quot; (Terrace 1979: 145). Nim was raised like a human child and taught
sign language in similar ways to those of Washoe. He was observed practicing
his signs in the absence of their referents (Terrace 1979: 143). Nim often
signed DIRTY (used when he had to go to the toilet) or SLEEP when he was bored
and wanted a change. He used the signs BITE and ANGRY to express his feelings,
and he tended not to attack if he perceived that his warning was heeded; this
is an important substitution of an arbitrary word for a physical action,
displaying Hockett's property of specialization (the speaker does not act out
messages). Although Nim learned many words, Terrace concluded that Nim could
not combine words to create new meanings on his own. He believed, from viewing
videotapes, that the combinations of words that Nim used were prompted by prior
utterances from his trainers. The other thing Terrace discovered from the
videotapes was that Nim interrupted his trainers more than human children
interrupt their parents. Terrace has a good point: if we are going to say that
apes can create a sentence, we must eliminate the other possible explanations
for the utterances (Terrace 1979: 219). Terrace is not as much of a skeptic as
some others make him out to be, though; he believed that the conditions under
which Project Nim were operated were not ideal, and future projects might have
more success if they were able to instill a greater motivation to sign in their
subjects (Terrace 1979: 223). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problems began when another chimp began his career as a
language student, commuting daily to Columbia University in New York. The
researcher, Herb Terrace [sp?], was trying to replicate the Gardner study using
his own ape, called Nim Chimsky. The name was a lighthearted dig at linguist
Noam Chomsky, who believed language ability was confined to the human species.
Terrace hoped to teach Nim to assemble signs into sentences, using the rules of
grammar, but the experiment did not turn out quite as Terrace planned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>HERB TERRACE:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
main goal of Project Nim was to ask whether a chimpanzee could create a
sentence. I have concluded that, unfortunately, the answer to that question is
no.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] In this example, Nim seems to be using a combination of
signs to ask if he can hug the cat, but Terrace argued that he was not actually
making a sentence. By freezing the tape, you can see that first the trainer
makes the sign for hug, and just a few frames later, Nim copies her. Next, the
trainer signs cat, and shortly after, so does Nim. Terrace concluded that
chimps cannot produce language, they can just imitate their trainers. Terrace
also looked at some of the Gardners' films. He decided that Washoe, too, was
being led by her teacher. The Gardners disagreed, and attacked Terrace's
methodology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. GARDNER:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Well,
Herb Terrace set out to prove that if you use Skinnerian reinforcement you
could teach a chimpanzee syntax. It was an entirely different objective from
ours. And when he failed, he declared that everybody had failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] The Gardners also point out that in the disputed example,
Washoe's signs are quite different from her teacher's, and so can't possibly be
imitation. Susan is asking, `What that?' and Washoe answers, `Baby in my
drink.' This, they say, was a typical conversation, and was interesting because
of its similarity to ordinary conversations between adults and young children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. GARDNER:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>What we
were interested in is not whether it fitted some abstract theory of
linguistics, but whether the chimpanzees could actually communicate information
to us, things we didn't already know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] The Gardners continued their experiments with four more
chimps who, like Washoe, were all brought up as human children. They tested
their ability to communicate under controlled, double-blind conditions. The
chimp could see an image on the screen, but the experimenter could not. Two
independent observers had to agree for the sign to be marked correct. The
chimps showed reliable and consistent signing. They had vocabularies above 100
signs, and each used them in their own individual ways.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902587">Lana</a> </h2>

<p>The chimpanzee Lana learned to use another language system, an electronic
keyboard. The Lana Project was headed by Duane Rumbaugh, who wanted to create a
situation which would &quot;allow for the systematic variations of training
procedures that would differentially influence the course of acquiring and
using linguistic skills&quot; (Rumbaugh, Warner &amp; von Glasersfeld 1977:
87). The language of lexigrams, each of which represented one word, was called
Yerkish. When Lana pressed a key with a lexigram on it, that key would light up
and the lexigram would appear on a projector. When keys were pressed
accidentally, Lana used the PERIOD key (end of sentence) as an eraser so that
she could restart the sentence; Lana did this on her own before it occurred to
the researchers (Rumbaugh &amp; Gill 1977: 167). Lana also started using NO as
a protest (for example, when someone else was drinking a Coke and she did not
have one) after having learned it as a negation (&quot;it is not true
that...&quot;) (Rumbaugh &amp; Gill 1977: 169-170). Lana acquired &quot;many
linguistic-type skills for which she had received no specific training&quot;
which showed her ability to abstract and generalize (Rumbaugh &amp; Gill 1977:
190). For example, she spontaneously used THIS to refer to things for which she
had no name, and she invented names for things by combining lexigrams in new
ways. Lana's trainers admit that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto;margin-left:.5in'>we cannot assume that Lana 'understands' the meaning of
every word she uses as we do, but the consistent appropriateness of her novel
sentence constructions ... support the conclusion that she has conceptual
meanings for many of them and also for their relationships (Rumbaugh &amp; Gill
1977: 192).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>[voice-over]
One attempt at getting data free from bias involved Lana. Instead of sign
language, she was given a computer keyboard, with symbols to represent words.
The keys she pressed were automatically recorded, so there could be no argument
over what she had said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DUANE RUMBAUGH, Georgia State University:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The keys were made of plastic. They were
backlighted, and when they were touched they gained an additional level of
brilliance. Then a facsimile of the lexagram on the surface of the key was
produced in one of the projectors in a row above her keyboard, and thus she was
able to produce a string of lexagrams, if you would, a primitive sentence. So
this was the idea that launched the Lana project and the idea which, in fact,
has carried the research project with chimpanzees and also with children across
the time span now of better than 20 years.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc498902588">Kanzi, Matata and Panbanisha</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1979, Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, had started using a bonobo
named Matata in her studies. Matata was the first bonobo to be used in these
studies and it was expected that she would do well as bonobos were thought to
be generally more intelligent than common chimpanzees but the results were not
encouraging. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(1)</span> Her adopted son Kanzi,
however, seemed fascinated by the keyboard that she&nbsp; was trying to learn
to use. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(2)</span> At about the age of two, Kanzi
began to spontaneously use the keyboard to initiate a game of
&quot;chase&quot;. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(3)</span> At this point
Matata had spent 2 years on language training and mastered very few lexigrams.
She would become frustrated with the fact that she couldn't seem to make her
trainer understand what she wanted. It was thought that Matata's problem was
that she started language training at the age of 10 years, possibly too old for
language acquisition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the first official day of language training, Kanzi
astonished his trainers by knowing and using several keys on the keyboard
correctly to name items and to announce his intention. It appeared that
although his adopted mother Matata never mastered the keyboard, Kanzi had been
paying attention. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(4)</span> After 17 months,
Kanzi had a vocabulary of about fifty symbols and was regularly using
combinations of words. Unlike some other apes, Kanzi's multi word utterances
seemed to reflect real comprehension and 90% of these were spontaneous. <span
style='font-size:7.5pt'>(5)</span> Rumbaugh also believed that many of Kanzi's
communications had a character of novelty and functioned to suggest completely
new actions and alternatives to the normal way of doing things. He also used
three world utterances to indicate someone other than himself as the agent or
recipient of an action such as tickle or chase. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(6)</span>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next major breakthrough that Rumbaugh noted was that
Kanzi seemed to be capable of understanding human speech. This fact was amazing
in itself but seemed even more incomprehensible because there was no attempt to
train Kanzi to understand spoken language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This wasn't a new concept. Understanding of human language
was reported with Washoe and other apes but was refuted by Herbert Terrace in
1979. <span style='font-size:7.5pt'>(7) </span>In response to this, Rumbaugh
reported: </p>

</span>[voice-over] This conversation is the first time that the chimp Kanzi
has ever spoken on the telephone, using his talking keyboard. On the other end
of the phone was Janine Murphy. It was a conversation with someone not
physically present, about events yet to take place. It's not the kind of thing
which scientists thought chimpanzees could do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>This species is very, very rare and endangered, found only in a small
area of Zaire, and was only identified as a separate species in 1929. They
differ from the so-called common chimpanzee in a number of ways. First of all,
they have very stable large social groups in which there are strong ties
between males and females. They have a very, very low level of aggression, and
the society seems organized around caring for young bonobos. Subjectively, it
has an extraordinarily different feel from other chimpanzees. The facial
expressions of bonobos are much more humanlike. The vocalizations of bonobos
are much more frequent and much higher-pitched. Common chimpanzees, although
very wonderful creatures are, compared to the bonobo, somewhat stand-offish.
The bonobos like physical contact, they like to be around people. Kanzi's
mother, who was a wild-caught bonobo, is one of my very best friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Matada [sp?] was also the starting point for what has been
described as a groundbreaking project, to establish just how well a chimpanzee
can develop a competence with human language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>We began with Matada, and she was not a very adept pupil. Matada seemed
to have many ways of communicating. She would lead me around by the hand, she
would vocalize, she would look off in the distance and vocalize and gesture to
me, and I had no question but what she was trying to communicate with me. But
she seemed to think lexagrams were a rather ridiculous method of communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] But while Matada wasn't learning, her son Kanzi very
rapidly caught on to the possibilities of the keyboard when he was only a few
months old. He learned that each abstract symbol on the board meant something.
Here, he pressed `bite.' What he wanted was a bite of what Sue had in her
mouth. His use of symbols was the equivalent of a young child using single
words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ten years later, Kanzi easily identifies words spoken by complete
strangers, and can echo them by pressing the correct key on the lexagram board,
which now talks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TALKING KEYBOARD:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Potato. Shoe. Give.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>The most exciting thing with Kanzi was that he began to use this
keyboard very, very frequently. He clearly helped us understand that he knew
what those symbols meant. For example, if Kanzi said something like, `Chase
apple,' he then would go over and pick up the apple and start running away, and
look back at me, showing me behaviorally that he knew what he had said, and
gauging me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I first found out that Kanzi was learning language
without any attempt on my part to really teach him, it was just as we were
coming up for funding renewal. Kanzi was about three or three and a half years
of age, and the site visitors kept asking me, `Well, we understand that Kanzi's
doing this, we've seen him do it, we hear you say that he's learning how to
understand words in some sentences, but how is he doing it? How did you teach
him to do it? How did you get him to do it?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I was at a complete loss. I said, `Well, parents really
don't know how they teach their children language. Why should I have to know
how I teach Kanzi language? I just act normal around him and he learns it. I
don't really know what's going on in his head.' But they made me realize that,
unlike a parent, as a scientist I really had an obligation to figure out how
this was happening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kanzi was an ape, not a child, and so I wanted to construct
some kind of environment that would make the usage of language real for Kanzi.
And I asked myself, `Well, what do apes do in the wild?' Well, everyone knows
they travel around to different places and they find food and they eat it, so I
decided, because we had 55 acres of forest, to have certain feeding areas, and
to spend Kanzi's days traveling from place to place, talking about where we
were going to go, what kind of food we were going to eat, and what we were
going to do next.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>What we have begun to learn is that chimpanzees and, I suspect as well,
children have an intrinsic desire to try to figure out what's going to happen
to them next. They would like their world to be predictable, whether they're
going for a walk in the woods, whether they're going down to visit the river.
They'd sort of like to know, when they're very young, in particular, what everybody
is going to do next. And so, because they really want to know this, there's an
intrinsic desire to figure out what the language is about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Sue Savage-Rumbaugh is convinced that the combination of
all these everyday interactions at an early age is essential for the
acquisition of language. Scientists call this process enculturation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>All right. Your noodles are going to go in here, and you can have a few
of them for your tummy. Kanzi, could you turn the water off again, please? Turn
the water off, please.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] In the kitchen, in Sue's company, Kanzi functions
impressively. But does Kanzi, like a human, really have the ability to
understand words? He can match spoken words with lexagrams, but what do they
mean to him? Can he make the connection between words and things in the real
world under test conditions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A set of 16 photographs has been selected from the several
hundred which represent the nouns in his vocabulary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Okay, here's your pictures. Here's your pictures. Watch now, they're
coming around. All right. Kanzi, see if you can find mushrooms. Mushrooms.
That's right, those are the mushrooms. Real good. Can you turn back around?
Okay. Now, now- okay, you're doing real good, Kanzi. See if you can find Mardu
[sp?] the orangutan. Do you see Mardu? Good job. Good job. See if you can find
some melon. Melon. Melon. Thank you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Kanzi consistently scores better than 90 percent with such
sets of pictures. A more rigorous test involves Kanzi wearing headphones, so
only he can hear which picture is being requested.</p>

</span>Kanzi, give Sue bananas. That's right. Kanzi, give Sue ice. That's

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] The tests on single words are convincing, but how does
Kanzi deal with words in combination? How do researchers know that he is not
just doing the most obvious thing, given the range of possibilities available
to him? One of the hallmarks of human language is its creativity, the
possibility of expressing an infinite number of ideas. We can understand the
meaning of a sentence even if we have never heard its words in that particular
order ever before. Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh set out to test whether the same applied
to Kanzi. There were 600 sentences in all, designed to use different
grammatical forms and to be as unpredictable as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Give the doggie a shot. Good job. Put the keys in the refrigerator. Good
job. Thank you. Very nice. Okay. Go get the ball that's outdoors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] To do this, Kanzi has to ignore another ball which is
indoors. That Kanzi could comprehend and carry out such instructions is
interesting enough, but Dr. Savage-Rumbaugh went a step further. How did
Kanzi's understanding of language compare with that of human children? Janine
Murphy volunteered her daughter, Alea [sp?], to take part in an identical study
at the age of two years. On some sentence types, Kanzi excelled; on others the
child did better. But by and large, both were correct about three-quarters of
the time. So far as comprehension went, child and chimp were on a par.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Could you take my shoe off, please? You might need to untie it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] For both child and chimp, the ability to understand
outstripped their ability to produce language, the girl because of her age, and
Kanzi because the chimpanzee vocal tract does not allow it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Now you can take it off. It
will come off now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mr. SAVAGE:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>It is in
what an individual comprehends that we use as the basis for saying that
individual is language-competent. If they can't speak because of some anatomic
reason, we don't say, well, they don't have language. We say that they can't
speak and they need some other kind of medium for that.</p>

glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>For a long time, it was thought that only the human brain could
understand human speech. Now we know that Kanzi's brain can understand human speech,
which says very clearly that something important happened in our evolution. Our
brains were able to understand speech, and suddenly our mouths became able to
produce speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] The sudden emergence of speech from a hominid, which
hitherto had, like the ape, only a potential for language, may be linked with
our unique anatomy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>I suspect that there's something very, very unique about the human
bipedal posture and the human vocal laryngeal apparatus. One of the things that
we know it enables us to do is make sounds like ga and ba and pa and da, sounds
that we call consonants. Kanzi can't make these kinds of sounds. His sounds are
mostly vowel sounds. And if I try to talk to another person using only vowel
sounds, they can't understand me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Kanzi often tries to copy human speech, but analysis of the
voiceprints of human and bonobo shows the problem. The human print shows the
boundaries of the words clearly, where Kanzi's are blurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dr. SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>We tried to invent a language for Kanzi that was composed only of vowel
sounds, and we couldn't understand ourselves, which tells you what consonants
do for us. They wrap little packages around vowel sounds. They are like edges
around vowel sounds, and they help us tell our words apart, where one word
stops and another word starts. And because we could do that, we could invent
languages. We could utter new sounds that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>were discriminably different. We could go around and name all kinds of
things with words that sounded different to other individuals. And I think this
must have been a great turning point in the evolution of mankind. And I think
if you could give chimpanzees or bonobos that same ability today, they would
take off and they might follow a course that would be eerily similar to that of
our own species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>---</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Chimps do acquire complex skills in the wild, but this
happens slowly, over many years. Some groups have learned to use stones as
hammers and anvils to crack nuts. In Atlanta, they found that Kanzi was able to
grasp such a skill with amazing ease by watching a demonstration and then
trying it for himself in the forest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kanzi was also able to make his own tools after watching a
demonstration by a visiting archaeologist. He went on to show particular
insight and creativity in his approach to problem-solving. He was presented
with this puzzle box, held closed by a strong rope. He quickly caught on to the
solution, and also found his own way of making a sharp tool by throwing, rather
than striking the stones together in his hand. His way was just as effective.
Kanzi's ability to observe tool use and quickly adapt it for his own purposes
is very significant. This facility is not seen in wild chimpanzees, only in those
who have been exposed to human culture. Perhaps we are seeing in a chimpanzee
the same stages of learning that our ancestors must have experienced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Going back in time from the human species today, we see that
some three million years ago our ancestor might have looked something like
this, not very different yet from the way the bonobo chimps look today when
they walk upright, with hands free. Archaeology can reveal much about our own
past, but words leave no fossils, and scientists have to depend upon comparisons
between living species to draw conclusions about how our own capacity for
language might have come about. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh's findings point to an
origin of language which goes back several million years, and may even predate
human evolution.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902591">Language acquisition in apes vs children</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>PATRICIA MARKS GREENFIELD, UCLA:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>I think that there are a lot of people who are very worried about
us finding a relationship between humans and animals, and they want there to be
an absolute dividing line. What Terrace did was again to say, `Yes, there is a
line,' and I think people responded very emotionally. And instead of it just
being another point of view where it would be interesting to do further
research and see who was right, Terrace or the people who had done the early
work, such as the Gardners, the whole field just closed down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>[voice-over] Eventually, the Gardners' funding ran out, and their chimps
were moved to another university. The early dreams of rearing them to
adolescence and beyond were never fulfilled. While the eight researchers were
battling over Washoe, Nim and definitions of language, Patricia Greenfield was
taking a fresh look at how human children use their first words. If apes were a
species on the threshold of developing language, it seemed logical to compare
them with a child at a similar point. Her subjects were even closer to home.
She studied her own children, Matthew and Lauren. Here is Matthew with his
mother now, and this is Matthew, captured on film at the age of two as part of
the study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. GREENFIELD:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>I
knew all about the Chomskyan approach to child language development, which is
an approach in which grammar is very central, and the child is considered sort
of like a little grammar machine, or becoming a big grammar machine. And when
my daughter Lauren started to speak, what absolutely hit me was that this was
not- what she was doing was nothing like what they were describing. And in
fact, what they were describing were children combining words with words, using
rules, but what she was doing when she first started to talk was combining
words with things, with people, with gesture, all sorts of nonverbal elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want another piece of cheese?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LAUREN:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>[voice-over]
Greenfield showed that these verbal and nonverbal elements had a grammar of
their own. This was the foundation on which full-blown language would be built.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. GREENFIELD:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Would you like some potato?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LAUREN:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. GREENFIELD:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>But
that approach was very unpopular, and was very heavily criticized, I think to a
large extent because of the bias that words are realer than these nonverbal
elements, and that if somebody expresses something in a word, you know it was
really there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NARRATOR:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>[voice-over]
Greenfield, too, looked at the Gardners' films and saw that their chimps
combined word signs with gestures to get their meaning across. This could be
the same precursor to language as she had seen in children.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc498902586">Tatu</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ms. GARDNER:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Tatu,
unlike the others, had black as her very favorite color. We would go through
magazines, looking for black things, and she would go around naming black
things for you. `That's black, and that's black, and that is black.' And
sometimes you could even tease her about that. You'd go through a magazine and
she'd point at it, at a picture, and give you eye-to-eye contact - the
question, `What is that?' - and for a while, you played her game and you said,
`It's black, it's black,' using her favorite sign. But then you'd tease her and
say it was red, and of course she would correct you right away and say, `It's
black. That's black.' It's a very nice conversational use of sign language. She
knew the answer, but she wanted you to talk about that.</p>

populations number less than 20,000 individuals. This number is assumed to be
dropping. Political unrest in Zaire is preventing researchers from entering the
country, and has led to the end of negotiations with the government to set
aside more protected land for bonobo habitat. Previous to the war in Zaire,
reserves were being patrolled regularly in order to protect existing bonobo
populations from poaching. Today, the guards have left their stations because
of a lack of financial support and the threat of war. This leaves bonobos
completely unprotected. Researchers fear the worst.</span></p>

usually dies if its mother dies before it's weaned elaborate greeting
ceremonies - central male group does boundary control - when two animals come
together, dominant one puts arm over the other </p>

<p><b>communication</b> - 4 parts: signal, motivation, meaning, function -
what's the unit size of a signal - meaning is context-based - proximate
function is immediate, ultimate function is long-term </p>

<p><b>communication, basic</b> - what you can't lie about - sex, age, species,
sexual receptivity (estrus swelling), sickness, fear scent in gorillas </p>

<p><b>communication channel</b> - actual nervous input that comes into brain -
eg. sense of smell, touch, heating </p>

<p><b>communication, interactive</b> - individual has some choice with this -
eg. do I make a scent mark, threat </p>

<p><b>communication modality</b> - what you do with a particular channel -
olfactory channel: scent marking, pheromone production - visual channel: facial
gestures, hand and body gestures, piloerection, kinesis, proxemics- auditory
channel: clear calls, harsh calls </p>

<p><b>communication, nonverbal</b> - sounds, but not words </p>

<p><b>communication, nonvocal</b> - everything but sounds - subtle, fast,
accurate </p>

<p><b>displays</b> - set of behaviours that are ritualized and have become a
signal - stereotyped form (often exaggerated) and repeated, always at same
intensity - to release tension, intimidate others, keep others out of your
range - eg. gorilla chest beating, chimpanzee greeting - behaviour comes from
autonomic responses, intention movements, and displacement activities </p>

<p><b>dominance </b>- not a permanent trait, always within some context, not a
genetically inherited trait, can be for females as well as males </p>

<p><b>dominant</b> - an animal gets its own way </p>

<p><b>gelada, Theropithecus</b> (bleeding heart baboon) - sleep on cliffs in
mountainous regions of Ethiopia - groups fission when 7 or 8 females - several
groups make up a band, several bands make up a herd </p>

<p><b>gibbons</b> - heavily forest areas of SE Asia - ischial callosities -
don't make nests, sit in trees like monkeys - intermembral index 130+ (arms
longer than legs) - don't walk quadrupedally (or bipedally much) - territorial,
defend 90% of range - monogamous pairs - spend lots of time in canopy - lots of
grooming </p>

<p><b>gorillas</b> - berengi - mountain, grauri - eastern lowlands, gorilla -
western lowlands male-female relationship basis of cohesion of group - half of
their day is spent feeding males don't participate in raising children - eat
leaves, stems, bamboo, bark - females more arboreal (smaller) - build nests,
use them for one night only - chest beating is adult intimidation - adult male
may take baby if mother dies - walk on knuckles - lots of time sitting upright
- extensive overlap in ranges - get water from plants - females leave group
often when just presexual </p>

<p><b>hamadryas baboons</b> - male herds females in its group - other male
kidnaps young females and cares for them until they're sexually mature -
hamadryas male can herd anubis females - male will bite females who try to
leave group </p>

<p><b>Hanuman langurs</b> (Semnopithecus entellus) - sacred monkeys in India -
one-male or multi-male groups - lots of allomothering - in Dharwar, high
population density, infants may be killed in male takeovers of groups - in
Orcha, low population density, no male takeovers of groups </p>

<p><b>howler monkeys</b> - highly arboreal - 15 kg - hyoid bone in throat is
huge - bare patch on bottom of tail to grip tree - long fingers and toes,
prehensile tails - saecum to digest leaves </p>

<p><b>instinctive behaviour </b>- behaviour without observation, eg. clinging,
sucking, rooting ritualized (occurs same way each time), comes from a
particular stimulus (eg. hunger) </p>

<p><b>interaction, conflict</b> - neither participant gets what they want -eg.
males fighting over a female, another male takes it away </p>

<p><b>interaction, conflict assymetric</b> - one animal gives in because of
harassment - eg. male harasses a female until she lets him mount </p>

<p><b>interaction, mutual </b>- actions of animals are cooperative - eg.
grooming </p>

<p><b>interaction, reactive</b> - one animal attempts to interact, other
ignores - eg. male lets female eat nearby </p>

<p><b>Japanese macaques</b> - central-peripheral structure: leader males and
females in centre, then females, then young males - linear dominance hierarchy
- matrilinear structure important, males move into group - males care for
juveniles and infants in some groups <b>- </b>animal indicates where it wants
to be groomed by position </p>

<p><b>language</b> - allows us to deal with generalizations, abstractions,
symbols, past and future, distance from emotion - based on code system - it's a
second language for the apes - are they trying to please the researcher, solve
task, get what they want, or is it actual two-way communication - people who've
known each other for a long time don't use full sentences so why should apes </p>

<p><b>learned behaviour </b>- often variable, observed before doing it
successfully, stimulus variability - eg. mothering skills, communication </p>

<p><b>lemur, dwarf </b>(cheirogaleus) - store up fat in tails - become torpid
below 18 degrees and hibernate for 1-5 months - nest in holes in trees </p>

<p><b>lemur, mouse</b> (microcebus) - sleep alone or in groups in nests -
forage by themselves basically noyau - seasonal breeding </p>

<p><b>lemur, ring tail</b> (lemurcatta) - arboreal, quadrupedal - group living
- crepuscular seasonal breeding - stink fights </p>

<p><b>lion-tail macaques</b> - rare - grey wrap around face, darker coat - food
pouches - adult play more common than in other species </p>

<p><b>macaques</b> (macaca) - fuscata - Japanese, sylvanus - barbary, radiata -
bonnet, hemistrina - pigtail, fascicularis - crab-eater - female-bonded groups
- display with branch shaking - hybrids between subspecies occur both in wild
and captivity </p>

<p><b>marmosets</b> - ringed tails </p>

<p><b>orangutans</b> - rarely groom other animals - solitary animals much of
the time - young play with objects and each other - feet are prehensile - walk
with weight on fists females have ranges that overlap - males have much larger
ranges that overlap ranges of several females - pairs of adolescents may hang
out together - big throat sac to scare others away </p>

<p><b>pair</b> - male and female with offspring form group - territorial, not
much sexual dimorphism- eg. gibbons, siamangs </p>

<p><b>prosimians</b> - wet rhinarium - vibrissae - tapetum - longer nose,
sideways-facing eyes mixture of nails and claws - less manipulative hands -
multiple young - use a nest more teeth - tethered upper lip - often nocturnal -
vertical clinging and leaping, branch walking or running - arboreal, sense of
smell important </p>

<p><b>range</b> - area that includes places to sleep, water, food rank - level
of social influence </p>

<p><b>Sade's hypothesis</b> - offspring are in their mother's dominance shadow
- animals rise to the rank of their mother in normal circumstances </p>

<p><b>safari pairs</b> - consorting couple - could last for a couple of months
- move to edge of group and hang out together - eg. chimpanzees </p>

<p><b>selection, k</b> - fewer offspring, more parental care - usually in
larger animals (within primates) </p>

<p><b>selection, R</b> - shorter life span, more offspring born and more lost -
smaller, terrestrial primates </p>

<p><b>sexual dimorphism</b> - males and females look different - size, hair
growth pattern, colour of fur, size of canines - terrestrial primates are reasonably
sexually dimorphic in spider monkeys, females are bigger than males </p>

<p><b>silverback</b> - mature male gorilla, usually only one in a group </p>

<p><b>social facilitation </b>- when one animal does something and then
everybody does it </p>

<p><b>sociobiology</b> (contrast with behaviourist) - behaviour is based on a
determined genetic background - eg. altruistic, infant care, aggressive
behaviours </p>

<p><b>sociosexual behaviour</b> - genital-genital rubbing between males and
between females, juveniles and infants engaging in sex - eg. bonobos </p>

<p><b>territoriality</b> - defending area against others of same species </p>

<p><b>tool use</b> - modify shape of what you' re using to fulfill a function
better - eg. chimpanzees using sticks to get termites and ants </p>

<p><b>vervets</b> - multi-multi groups - eat figs, fruit, new leaves, flowers,
insects, bark, gum, grass, corms, roots - cheek pouches - males protect group
(lots of enemies) - use bipedal posture to look around </p>
