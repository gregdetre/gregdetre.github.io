<h2>Notes � �Laughter�, Bergson</h2>

<h2>Notes � �Bergson�, Kolakowski</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Bergson argues that all the
varieties of objects and situations which provoke laughter � whether
deliberately produced, as in comdedies and jokes, or arising unintentionally in
daily life � can be ultimately reduced to a type of human behaviour which displays
the characteristics of mechanical movement (Kolakowski, pg 66)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>The comic is that side of a
person in which he resembles a thing; it is that aspect of human events which,
by a special kind of rigidity, imitates a mechanism pure and simple, an automatism,
a lifeless movement. It thus expresses an individual or collective imperfection
which calls for immediate correction. Laughter is this very corrective.
(Laughter, pp 66-7)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Laughter is normally
associated with emotional insensibility; the comic side of events or words is
addressed only to our intelligence, not to our feelings. If we laught at a
person who, in trying to sit down on a chair, lands on the floor, this is
because the flexibility and purposefulness of human acts are suddenly replaced
by mechanical forces. Various human vices become ridiculuous in a comedy as a
result of their automatic character, their lack of elasticity, and the
inability of a person to adapt himself to the human environment. Life does not
repeat itself: a living person repeating himself behaves like a machine and
thereby provokes laughter. A law or regulation might become comical if it is
applied with a rigid consistency. A tragic hero becomes comical when he sits
down in the middle of a high-flown speech: we suddenly realise that he has a
body, and if body prevails over soul, the effect is similar to the contrast
that emerges whena mechanism is substituted for the human body. When Moli��s
physician declares that it is better to die in accordance with medical rules
than to be cured despite them, he makes us laugh because of professional
automatism he displays. If a person gives the impression of being a thing, he
is bound to become ridiculous. Repetitiveness is a favourite trick in comedies:
when Moli��s Harpagon, confronted with many arguments against marrying his
daughter to a man does not love, repeats obstinately �without a dowry!�, he is
comica; as is orgon, repeating his question, �and what about Tartuff?� when
informed of his wife�s illness. They produce the effect of a toy in which a
figure, attached to a string, jumps out, no matter how hard we try to keep it
in its place. If an apparently human act turns out to result from mechanical
causes, we react with laughter. The plot in many comedies consists in the fact
that the same situation occurs repeatedly in different circumstances, or is
reversed. Repeatability and reversibility are the characteristics of a machine:
in human actions, they make us laugh. Distraction is notoriously comical
because it represents the loss of human ability to adjust to changes. Virtue
becomes ridiculous if it is rigid (like the misanthrope�s veracity) and reveals
the person� unsociability. Other examples are provided by people who are
incapable of adjusting their ideas to reality: Don Quixote makes us laugh when
he moulds his perceptions according to a preconceived idea and sees giants
instead of windmills because it is giants that he needs.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>When mechanically acting
forces are inserted into a chain of human actions, they reveal the incompatability
of social and human life with the characteristics of an automaton. Laughter is
a corrective reaction of the human intelligence, reason�s resistance to the
confusion of the human with the mechanical, a reassertion of humanity.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bergson believed the universe to be under the guidance of a
creative and loving Person, a super-consciousness directing the course of
evolution in beyond Darwinian terms, which he termed <i>�n</i> (an
intuitively perceived life- force in Bergson�s philosophy; any mysterious
life-force, esp. one supposed to have caused the variations from which new
species have emerged.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>The central idea of Bergson�s
cosmology is this: the Whole is of the same nature as myself. The
time-generating lfie of the consciousness is the model for the universe. Our
inner experience of time is the most irresistible fact we encounter. We should
start with the real stream of conscious life, after dispensing with the
�geometrical� prejudices of psychology and physics (Bergson�s is not a
psychological approach: psychology is a natural science with has taken its
rules from more developed areas, and is bound to objectify the mind and to
impose on it the abstract figment of physical time, a derivative of spatial
imagination). How do I perform this leap from myself to the universe? By
intuition, presumably, by trying to coincide with the great pulse of life.
Intuition, however, admittedly cannot have equivalents int eh analytical effort
and is not properly translatable into reational categories. perhaps it delivers
us truth after all, but if so, its truth is beyond the scope of language. It is
in keeping with Bergson�s philosophy to say that our Platonic prejudices have
deeper roots than the restrictions of modern science: they are inherent in
language itself. our language is of course historically relative: no word may
claim to reflect the world as it is in itself, but it is the tool we have at
our disposal. It is therefore unlikely that it could reach absolute reality,
divine or otherwise.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

in appropriate people through their awareness or cognition of it, and not for
ulterior reasons.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>The three leading ideas in
philosophical theories of humour are those of incongruity, superiority and
relief or release<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>something is funny if it in

<p class=MsoNormal>makes a confusing distinction between conceptual elucidation
and causal explanation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>objective vs subjective questions: �what is it for something
to be humorous?� vs �what is it for someone to find something humorous?�</p>

<h3>Incongruity</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>The hallmark of incongruity
theory is that it locates the humorous in some incongruity presented by or
perceived in some item. The humorous item may be itself incongruous, relative
to some assumed other object, or it may involve or contain incongruity. There
have been various interpretations of the incongruity of items or elements,
ranging from logical impossibility or paradoxicality, to absurdity and
irrelevance, to unexpectedness and general inappropriateness. Incongruity
theorists include Schopenhauer, Hazlitt, Kierkegaard, A. Koestler, D.H. Monro
and perhaps Kant.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Kant: <i>�the sudden transformation
of a strained expectation into nothing� (1790)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Schopenhauer: <i>the essence of
the ludicrous, he claimed, lies in the incongruity between concepts, the
vehicles of abstract thought, and concrete objects, apprehended in perception,
when the incongruity is grasped of a sudden. The mismatch of thought and
perception can appear from either of two directions: a single concept can be
applied to two very different objects, which only awkwardly encompasses them
both (�wit�), or two objects originally ranged under a given concept can be
subsequently realized to be fundamentally disparate (�folly�)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Koestler: <i>double association
of an item in respect of two different and incompatible reference frames or
interpretive matrices at once.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Modern incongruity theorists regard incongruity as
necessary, but not sufficient for humour.</p>

<h3>Superiority</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Superiority theorists, who include Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes,
Alexander Bain and Henri Bergson (�6), construe humour as rooted in the
subject�s awareness of superiority, in some respect, to the humorous object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hobbes: humorous laughter is �sudden glory� in one�s
eminence or fortune, in contrast with another or one�s former self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bergson (1899): comic as essentially �the encrustation of
the mechanical on the living� - a falling-off from the human ideal of
flexibility, suppleness and accommodation. The observer of this, for Bergson,
accordingly feels superior, takes pleasure in so feeling, and manifests their
pleasure naturally in laughter at the imperfectly human. Comedy and emotion are
held to be incompatible, since comic engagement by its very nature
short-circuits emotional involvement. In addition,Bergson maintains that comic
laughter is a social corrective that chastises and hopefully reforms the
socially undesirable rigid behaviour at which it is directed.</p>

<h3>Relief</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Spencer and Freud, the most
well-known relief theorists, locate the essence of the humorous in the relief
from psychic constraint or the release of accumulated mental energy that it
affords (see Freud �4).<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Spencer (1911): <i>it�s
important to investigate not only the features of humour, but why it is
specifically laughter that humour induces, thus necessitating a physiological
explanation. The explanation he offers emphasizes nervous tension and its
bodily manifestation when suddenly excessive or redundant.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Freud (1905): <i>extensive
typology of jokes in terms of their structures and techniques. He viewed the
enjoyment of jokes as rooted in an economy of psychic energy, namely, that of
inhibition or repression. With innocent jokes, the inhibition is against
nonsense and pure play, while with tendentious jokes, the inhibition is against
a display of aggression or sexuality, but in both cases the energy of
inhibition thus freed up manifests itself as pleasure.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pretty much all of the major theorists could be
re-classified.</p>

<h3>Analysis of humour</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>A number of considerations must be borne in mind when formulating an
adequate analysis of humour, that is, an answer to the question �What is
humour?� construed conceptually. Most of these concern the proper relationship
of humour to other phenomena, such as laughter, emotion, pleasure and aesthetic
appreciation. First, humour and laughter are not coextensive, that is, not all
laughter, by any means, is occasioned by humour. Laughter can result from, among
other things, tickling, nitrous oxide, organic disorder, joy, embarrassment or
vengeful exultation. Second, not all humour is productive of laughter, even in
appropriate subjects; humour may engender amusement without any behavioural
manifestation, or with only the lesser one of smiling. Third, humour does not
always produce amusement, its characteristic pleasure, even in appropriate
subjects; certain background conditions of mood or psychic preparedness also
need to be met. Fourth, humour seems to have both a cognitive and an affective
component, which are bound up together in the response.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<h2>Notes � �Humour�, Oxford companion to the mind</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most dictionary definitions when defining humour include the
psychologist�s three usages:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>stimulus � �comicality�</p>

margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>disposition � �state of mind�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Drever�s Penguin Dictionary of Psychology: much narrower
definition of humour:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the �character of a complex
situation exciting joyful and in the main, quiet, laughter, either directly,
through sympathy, or through empathy�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>provocative definition of
laughter: an �emotional response, expressive normally of joy, in the child and

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1930s, Ludovici argued that humour was the principal
cause of the decadence of the times, and laughter was a sinister behaviour.
Humour and laughter have only come to be regarded as important in recent times,
e.g. the Bible, where there is little mention of non-scornful laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Humour is valued as a way of
preserving order, changing group esteem and cohesion, expressing allegiances
and revealing attitudes with relative impunity, testing the standing of a
relationship, maintaining or undermining a status hierarchy<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plato <i>Philebus</i> (355BC) � saw the weak as a
justifiably prime target for humour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Freud (1905, 1928) � synthesis of incongruity, relief and
conflict, distinguished �comic�, �wit� and �humour � granted relief through
diverting energy from unpleasant emotion. Techniques in �joke-work� shared with
�dream-work�, especially �condensation� and �displacement� � deviations from
normal thought and representation, entail an economy of thought and expression.
The ludicrous always results in saving expenditure of psychic energy � the joke
is brief, and the amusement is the most economical response to the joke. Humour
can lift repressions, and is an important defence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Modern approaches focus on mini-theories, e.g.:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>stimulus � content, structure,
complexity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>individual differences �
personality, cognitions, physiology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>overt expression � verbal and
non-verbal reactions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>social influences � effects of
companions and audiences</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This modern approach tacitly recognises that we sometimes
laugh even when things aren�t humorous, that we can laugh in pretty much any
circumstances or state of mind � quote from <i>The sense of humour</i> (Potter,
1954) about the diverse situations that evoke laughter, from sensations,
novelty, other people, awkwardness, nervousness, creative pleasure, relief, sex
jokes etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Laughter is difficult to study in the lab, because few
people laugh out loud there, and so laughter is often excluded from indices of
humour appreciation.</p>

theories, dismissing them all to some extent, mainly because they don�t cover
all of the features that a general theory of laughter needs to. He replaces
them with his theory, that laughter arises out of (and, in the opposite causal
direction, can give rise to) a pleasant, (usually sudden) psychological shift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is defining �humour� as the �humour of incongruity�.
Where one has no expectations at all, like an infant, things are funny because
they are novel and surprising. By adulthood, we have formed a robust,
wide-ranging and abstract conceptual schema, where everything has connotations,
relations to other things and produces expectations. The �incongruous� is
relative to our picture of the congruous, and varies across periods, cultures,
ages and individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>crying = disappointment + helplessness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boston (1974): humour �consists primarily in what is
observed, whereas wit originates in the observer.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He distinguishes incongruity of things and incongruity of
presentation, and the various forms these incongruities can take, including
people, actions, conversation etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He discusses the various criticisms, dismissals and
arguments against laughter, humour and comedy, going on to argue that there is
something fundamentally valuable or pleasurable in humour, that it is an
aesthetic experience enjoyable in its own right, rather like watching the sun
rise. Of course, there can�t be any danger or anger which would detract from
the experience, just as we cannot enjoy a piece of art under threat or
practical engagement (e.g. avarice) � indeed, an aesthetic experience can be
defined as �attending to some object of awareness for the sake of the
experience itself�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humour is a necessary and dynamic part of learning. He
rebuts Plato�s three charges:</p>

margin-left:53.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>he doesn�t buy the superiority
theory � at least, not as a theory of humour � it�s all about pleasant
psychological shifts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The medievals were right when they said that it is because
we are rational animals that we are the animals that laugh. He sees an intimate
relationship between a playful, perceptive, imaginative use of reason and
humour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He talks of humour in terms of distancing oneself from the
here and now. Humour �views life, even life now, in as soft a light as we view
the past� (Leacock). It�s also profoundly liberating, which is why strict
regimes are always so fearful of humour�s subversive character (e.g. Hitler�s
joke courts, set up to try people naming animals �Adolf�), even sometimes
trying to use the �weapon of satire� to their own ends, e.g. the Russian humour
journal, <i>Krokodil</i>. Victor Frankl went on to incorporate humour into his
psychotherapeutic techniques, said of the concentration camps:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Unexpectedly, most of us were
overcome by a grim sense of humour. We knew we had nothing to lose except our
ridiculously naked lives � Humour was another of the soul�s weapons in the
fight for self-preservation � Humour more than anything else in the human
make-up can afford an aloofnes and an ability to rise above any situation, if
only for a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>few seconds�.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He likens the humorous attitude to the �philosophical attitude�,
in that both allow one to step back from the practical situation, and take a
calmer, more objective, less emotionally-coloured view of things. Humour is
also important in stressful situations, e.g. emergency areas in hospitals. A
sense of humour �frees us from vanity, on the one hand, and from pessimism on
the other by keeping us larger than what we do, and greater than what can
happen to us�. He considers the effect of dissipating brainwashing that humour
can have and its possible implications for both mental and physical health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He discusses the ethics of humour, arguing that situations
where cruelty, scorn, derision or detaching from a situation (e.g. where
someone gets run over, or close calls when drink driving) are wrong normally,
are the same as those when there is an added dimension of humour. Finding
humour in situations can be morally objectionable whenever it involves our
distancing ourselves too much from the situation, e.g. laughing at someone who
lightly bangs their head is fine, but someone who hurts themselves is not �
this is Aristotle�s way of looking at things, cf the Golden Mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then points to the extremely social aspects of humour:
the fact that we rarely laugh alone, that laughter is infectious in groups,
that being the only person laughing is a form of exclusion, that laugher in a
quarrel usually signals the end of the quarrel, that a shared joke signals
acceptance amongst new acquaintances etc. He argues that this social aspect
comes under the non-dangerous, non-priority, non-practical conditions necessary
for an aesthetic experience. Humour is also a good way to smooth difficult
interactions, and say difficult things, perhaps because it take this more
�objective� stance. The level of shared non-manipulative humour is a good
indication of intimacy. He supplies some examples of institutionalised humour
and jesting through the ages, e.g. the �fool society� of the Babinian Republic
in Poland (King: Do you have a king? BR: As long as you are alive, we would
never dream of electing another.), American tribal jester classes, Mardi Gras,
Egyptian Pharaoh festivals etc. He ends with a quote from Erasmus� <i>In praise
of Folly</i>, where Folly, a goddess-figure, explains how we all need folly in
almost every moment of our daily lives just to keep from despair, to enable us
to live with ourselves and love others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His views on the extent to which a sense of humour improves
and affects one�s mental life are OTT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He quotes Nietzsche�s description of humanity and its
intelligence as insignificant to the universe. The ultimate humour arises �from
the incongruous contrast between the eager fret of our life and its final
nothingness� (Leacock) � the human condition itself is funny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast, the Christian world-view places our every
action, inaction, idle word and joke in the context of a life that should be
devoted to the divine will. A true Christian would be truly humourless, and
indeed Christ shows no signs of humour � some figurative language, although the
example of a camel through a needle being more likely to go to heaven than a
rich man is ridiculous enough to perhaps bring a smile to our lips if we
consider it. And God himself could never find anything funny, since in his
omniscience he could experience no psychological shifts, and even incongruities
would simply be aberrations from his grand scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Incarnate Word was never known to laugh. For Him who knows all
things, whose powers are infinite, the comic does not exist�.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all religions are like this. Greek polytheism and
Buddhism are obvious exceptions. The humorous view in general sees nothing as
�of absolute importance, nothing monopolises attention. The world is seen as a
place not only for practical activity, but also for play, not all situations
have practical significance � there are many free moments simply to be
enjoyed.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if we follow Camus in thinking that the only really
important question is whether we should commit suicide, Morreall suggests that
humour gives a strong reason for answering No. �If only for the amusement it
provides, life is worth living.�</p>

<h2>Points</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>by humour, I am appealing to a difficult distinction to pin
down, but one that is intuitively obvious � the difference between being told a
joke, and being tickled</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>consider the humour behaviour of children</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there anything important I can say about �suitcase� terms
in general, like humour, consciousness, intentionality etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>humour + intentionality???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>like aesthetics, and ethics, the problem in defining humour
is that we can only appeal to our intuition through examples. is there a
parallel with consciousness, being privileged??? no, because anyone can tell if
I'm laughing � but I might be silently amused�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humour as related to potency, e.g. British developing irony
in response to loss of world power, American lack of it, the gods have humour,
Baudelaire quote</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the diverse range of humour as an attack on the unity of
consciousness, modularisation in the brain, innateness??? what about a general
attack on non-connectionist ways of thinking about things, taking a heavily
operationalist standpoint � neobehaviourism???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humour and ethics � humour as a virtue???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about a general discussion of the connectionist
paradigm vs mind???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what role do god and the gods play in humour??? what about
humour, pain and immortality???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humour and religion/seriousness??? � different religions
encourage different levels of seriousness of world view</p>

surprised when our perspective was subverted into a first-person explanation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is it cognitive???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>did it evolve??? does it have an adaptive function???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there anything that links consciousness and humour???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humour vs <i>rationality</i>???</p>

<h3>Humour as the key to our humanity</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>is humour the key to our humanity??? perhaps our
Britishness�</p>

fundamentally linguistic???</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<h3>Bergson</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>why do we feel pity/disgust/contempt/worry, rather than
laughter, at people who are unable to adapt to the physical environment??? why
do we ostracise them in the playground???</p>

social teaching function � after, all we laugh at the gangly kid at school too.

mechanical-seeming</p>

the future�s) advanced machines, and the perception of people as themselves
meat-machines???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>perhaps he�d say that this is what
laughter is all about � it�s about moving away from our inherent laughable
machineness, towards the flexibility that our aliveness adds/is, and that more
and more complex machines would be less and less funny???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would the Eternal Recurrence be funny???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the mere prospect of automatism funny, or is it only when
it is in the context of automaton-like humans, or more specifically, only acts
committed by humans that are reminiscent of automata???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has humour evolved??? can it be described wholly as an
adaptive function???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mustn�t animals have humour too, then??? or are they
themselves always too highly machine-like???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does that mean that the more machine-like, the funnier
something is???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can we talk of anything other than acts/events being
funny??? can people, or situations, or places be funny???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are there different strands of humour???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are �humour� and �laughter� synonymous??? what about
tickling???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about humour in a pre-mechanistic age???</p>

<h3>Minsky</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>can we incorporate the element of surprise into Minsky�s
account of humour as censorship???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

attention on the absurdity or joke or whatever, perhaps putting it into a
short-term memory where it can be absorbed by a censor???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how do Minsky and Dennett differ in their pandemonic views
of mind???</p>

<h3>Routledge</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>but laughter and mirth aren�t always positive, are they???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doesn�t his theory cover <i>too much</i>, i.e. aren�t there
pleasant psychological shifts which don�t make us laugh??? or if not, then he
may have pinned down laughter, but at the expense of explaining the more interesting
phenomenon of humour???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aren�t most of the supposedly �humourous laughter
situations� fairly non-humorous??? is whether something is humorous or not easy
to distinguish???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about his story about his friend filling up the
radiator with petrol by accident � how is that a <i>pleasant</i> psychological
shift???</p>

experience), and laughter is a positive emotional shift � what if the two
mix???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how has humour evolved???</p>

powerful effect, e.g. in the concentration camps???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does he adequately explain the social aspect of humour �
surely there�s more to it than just an objective, flexible perspective, and
non-threatening conditions???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can one be religious and humorous???</p>
