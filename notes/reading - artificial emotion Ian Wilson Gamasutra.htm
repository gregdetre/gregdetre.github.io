<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Artificial
Emotion:<br>
Simulating Mood and Personality</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Characters that display
emotion are critical to a rich and believable simulated environment, especially
when those characters interact with real people possessing real emotions.
Emotion is the essential element that creates the difference between robotic
behavior and lifelike, engaging behavior. Traditionally, animators have
painstakingly created these behaviors for prerendered animations. This
approach, however, is not possible when we wish to use autonomous, interactive
characters that possess their own unique personalities and moods. Truly
interactive characters must generate their behavior autonomously through
techniques based upon what I call artificial emotion (AE).</span> </p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Why do we have real emotion?</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>As human beings, we have an innate
understanding of what emotions are. However, outside of academia, we rarely
hear discussions on how emotions are produced and, more importantly, on why we
have emotions. Within academia, these issues are subject to much contention and
debate. That said, allow me to offer my own thoughts on these issues.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>When attempting to simulate natural systems,
we first need to ask, &quot;What is the nature of this system and what is its
purpose or reason for being?&quot; Very few, if any, systems in the natural
world exist for no reason</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Emotions are an integral part of our
decision-making systems. Emotions tune our decisions according to our
personalities, moods, and momentary emotions to give us unique responses to
situations presented by our environment. But why do we need unique responses to
situations? Why don�t we all have the same responses? To answer this question,
we need to look beyond the individual at humanity as a group or society of
individuals. I believe personality has evolved as a problem-solving mechanism.
Our unique personalities determine that we all think and hence solve problems
in unique and different ways. In an evolutionary sense, this diverse method of
solving problems is highly effective. If we had only one method of problem solving
there would be a large, if not infinite, number of solutions that would be
outside of our problem solving capabilities. So personality has evolved as a
way of attacking problems from many different angles: from bold high-risk
solutions to cautious and precise incremental solutions; from solutions
discovered though deep thought and reflection to solutions discovered by
gaining knowledge from others (socializing). </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Emotion is, to a large degree, an emergent
system. Its use must be looked at in terms of its interaction with society
rather than in isolation to gain a better understanding of its reason for
being. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>We can look at a corporation as an example.
Here, at the top of the hierarchy, we have a CEO who is bold and fearless,
making broad decisions with little regard to details. At the other end of the
hierarchy, we might find someone who is fearful of the unknown, is timid, and
has great respect for details. The organization, and in a greater sense
society, needs both types of people and the many others in between to function
efficiently. Imagine if we all had identical decision-making systems, which
gave us all the same responses to situations, but those responses were wrong.
We wouldn�t last very long as a species.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Layers of emotion</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Fundamental to our AE-based behavior system
is the notion that emotions comprise three layers of behavior. At the top level
are what we term momentary emotions; these are the behaviors that we display
briefly in reaction to events. For example, momentary emotions occur when we
smile or laugh at a joke or when we are surprised to see an old friend
unexpectedly. At the next level are moods. Moods are prolonged emotional states
caused by the cumulative effect of momentary emotions. Underlying both of these
layers and always present is our personality; this is the behavior that we
generally display when no momentary emotion or mood overrides <b>(Figure 1)</b></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>These levels have an order of priority.
Momentary emotions have priority over mood when determining which behavior to
display. One�s mood, in turn, has priority over one�s personality <b>(Figure 2)<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Figures 1 and 2 show the various layers of
emotional behavior. Momentary emotions are brief reactions to events that
assume the highest priority when we select our behavior. These momentary
behaviors are short-lived and decay quickly. Moods are produced by momentary
emotions, usually by the cumulative affects of a series of momentary emotions.
Moods can gradually increase in prominence even after the momentary emotions
have subdued. The development of moods depends on whether the momentary
emotions are positive or negative (punishments or rewards in a reinforcement
sense). If a character were to receive a stream of negative momentary emotions,
then the mood would obviously be bad and would decay slowly. The personality
layer is always present and has a consistent level of prominence. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The behavior that a character displays
depends upon each emotional layer�s prominence. The more prominent the layer,
the higher the probability of that behavior being selected. </span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Where can we use AE?</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>With the notable exceptions of P.F. Magic�s <i>Catz</i>
and <i>Dogz</i> series, Fujitsu�s <i>fin fin</i>, and Cyberlife�s <i>Creatures</i>
series, autonomous AE of any significant depth is rarely seen in the world of
interactive entertainment. Why is this the case? </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The field of interactive entertainment is
dominated by genres that require the user to either conquer and/or to kill
everything in his or her path. Little emotion is required by the opposition,
besides perhaps a little hard-coded fear or aggression that manifests itself in
simple movement patterns. Emotion primarily serves a social function in
interactive entertainment. Emotional responses are used to make the characters
that we encounter believable and engaging. For example, if we were to walk into
a virtual bar and all of the characters in the bar had distinct personalities,
the scene would be a very immersive and believable social situation. If the
characters showed no emotion, our suspension of disbelief would be immediately
broken and we would be reminded that we were in a computer-generated simulation
rather than in our own fantasy world. Of course, if all of the bar�s customers
had guns and our sole purpose was to dispatch them to a simulated afterlife,
then this really wouldn�t constitute a social situation and emotion might not
be required.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>A key to the use of AE, then, is the context
of situations in which it is used. An important area of growth is in the field
of girls� entertainment, pioneered by Purple Moon and its friendship adventures
built on Brenda Laurel�s excellent research into girls� play behavior and girls
and sport. For more information on Ms. Laurel�s research, see <a
href="http://www.purple-moon.com/cb/laslink/pm?stat+corp+play_behavior">http://www.purple-moon.com/cb/laslink/pm?stat+corp+play_behavior</a>
and <a href="http://www.purple-moon.com/cb/laslink/pm?stat+corp+girl_sport">http://www.purple-moon.com/cb/laslink/pm?stat+corp+girl_sport</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Social cooperation is a key element in this
area and as such is an ideal place to use autonomous characters with AE. In
these situations, the characters� emotional states and their emotional
responses to the players� actions are what make the experience enjoyable,
interesting, and entertaining. After playing the first of Purple Moon�s titles,
I was a little disappointed to find that it used only static animations, which
limited its sense of immersion. A full, living, 3D world would have increased
its impact (and cost) dramatically</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Of course, processor overhead is always a problem
with an element as computationally complex as AE. The reason that <i>Catz</i>, <i>Dogz</i>,
and<i> Creatures</i> succeed in displaying characters with believable emotional
behavior is that this element is generally the games� sole area of concern.
Graphics and other elements are kept to an acceptable minimum so that maximum
resources can be devoted to behavior generation. As we�re not yet at the stage
where we can throw unlimited resources at character AE, we should learn from
those titles that employ it successfully and design our simulations
intelligently with these constraints in mind. In other words, fight the battles
you can win. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Still, a significant amount of ingenuity and
optimization would certainly contribute to the use and availability of AE.
Consider the graphics technique of LOD (level of detail), in which objects
farther from the viewer are displayed in progressively lower and lower levels
of detail. Using LOE (level of emotion), characters farther away from the
viewer would generate and display progressively lower and lower levels of
emotion. If a character is out of sight, we generally don�t care about its
emotional state. In addition, one can also be careful in the choice of
characters to use. Using human characters necessarily implies that their
behavior is deep and complex. Unfortunately, because we are most attuned to
recognizing human emotion, we are also very well attuned at recognizing flawed
human behavior, which can break the illusion of an otherwise well-constructed
simulated environment. One way to attack this problem is to use nonhuman
characters. Cats, dogs, and Norns all show engaging levels of interactive
emotional behavior that maintains the illusion of life without having, or
needing, the complexity of human emotional responses.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>An important point to reiterate here is that
we�re specifically dealing with autonomous interactive characters. These
characters have responses and behaviors that cannot be prescripted or
predefined to any great degree and must instead employ systems that are able to
produce behavior in response to changes in the environment and interactions
with the user.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>How can we use AE?</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Artificial emotion produces two fundamental
components as output: gestures and actions. Actions are a general category and
are dependent upon the context of the situation in which the character exists.
A simulation�s movement system uses AE to select and/or modify an action. When
selecting an action, AE indicates what actions are appropriate to the
character�s personality and current mood. So a timid character is unlikely to
do anything aggressive, for example. When modifying an action, AE can help to
determine how an action is carried out. An outgoing, extroverted character
might perform an action enthusiastically, although this probably wouldn�t be the
case for an extreme introvert. Our primary use of AE, however, is in driving
gestures, namely hand, body, and facial gestures. Gestures are the way in which
we communicate our emotions to the outside world. Without them, we would seem
cold, flat, and unemotional � rather like a computer character. These AE-driven
gestures are tied directly to our characters� personalities and moods and
follow definite patterns. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>This body language adds an extra dimension
to a character�s behavior, giving life and depth to simulations populated by
autonomous characters that now posses unique personalities. We are all used to
seeing environments populated by characters that all have identical motions or
body language. They all stand stiffly upright and move like clockwork toys.
Would it not be refreshing to see a sad looking fellow, shoulders hunched over,
arms hanging limply and walking slowly as he makes his way through our
environment? This idea immediately introduces all sorts of theatrical and
cinematic possibilities, such as populating our environment with a whole cast
of unique characters. Our viewer�s experience would be enriched as well.
&quot;Who is that guy? Why does he look so sad? What�s his story? Should I go
and ask him?&quot; The kinds of questions that occur to the viewer of a truly
interactive experience are simply irrelevant without AE. </span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>(It should be noted that I could also substitute
the acting term character in place of my term personality. Character might be a
more appropriate term, but could confuse the reader because I�m using character
to indicate an autonomous agent in this article. The terms are, however,
interchangeable.)</span></p>

<p><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>The future of AE</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>I can imagine a scene; I�m searching for a
lost city in a wild, remote jungle with my trusted autonomous companion Aeida.
Suddenly, we find the entrance to the city and walk in. It�s still inhabited.
The inhabitants� body language changes when they see us, reacting to our sudden
intrusion. Some become fearful, backing away and curling into a nonthreatening
posture. Others do the opposite, standing upright, shoulders back, chest out,
and fists clenched � looks like trouble. We stand motionless for a time, until
a very jovial character smiles broadly at us, laughs, then comes over to greet
us, telling the other inhabitants to do likewise. The inhabitants� interactive
behavior, and more importantly their individual behavior, creates a living world
for us to explore and within which to entertain ourselves. This environment
would be socially oriented; our decisions and actions would be based upon the
personalities and moods of the characters that we encounter. Essentially, the
characters� decisions and actions would be interactively based upon ours;
nothing would be prescripted (unless the designer of the experience wished it
that way, as in interactive theatre).</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Such a world would require that designers
spend a good deal of time designing their characters for deep and engaging
roles<i>. </i>Designers will need to add the skills of scriptwriting and
storytelling to their growing repertoire of talents. Interactive theatre and
cinema is a relatively new area that is emerging around autonomous characters.
Those who are interested in participating in its development would be wise to
start their reading now. A great place to start looking is the web site
composed by Andrew Stern of P.F. Magic at <a
href="http://pw2.netcom.com/%7Eapstern/index.html">http://pw2.netcom.com/~apstern/index.html</a>.
Here you�ll find links to just about every conceivable source in these fields
and many more besides.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family:Arial'>The convergence of many factors � processor
speed, market awareness, and the maturation of the entertainment field to name
a few � will revolutionize the way in which we use characters in simulations.
Whole new avenues and genres will open up before us. The timing of these
developments may not be a moment too soon, considering the growing (and
plausible) perception that videogames turn kids into desensitized and violent
members of society. Designing experiences around social interaction may not
push your buttons, but society at large will probably thank you (and give you
lots of free press). This subject is full of real emotion, which could,
ironically, be averted through the use of artificial emotion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he has ignored the fact that emotion evolved long before our
problem-solving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>and our emotions affect us mostly in
domains outside the intellectual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:3.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>emotions are part of the ancient
reptilian brain, and perform far more basic functions, perhaps in terms of
assigning (phenomenological) value to actions + situations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that is why Artificial Emotion crucially has to be part of
AI, because it may be that it�s one of the things that are crucially missing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we evolved as individuals, not as a species � emotions, like
all other evolved faculties, need to give us survival value as individuals</p>
