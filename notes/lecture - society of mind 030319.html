<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 19, 2003</p>
<p>Steve Larson: maths as existing outside a consistent formal system?</p>
<p>pain as being an obstacle to other goals</p>
<p>drugs to keep awake</p>
<p>ideonomy � Dexadrone � Patrick Gunkel</p>
<p>new drug that keeps pilots awake for 36 hours</p>
<p>students taking crushed Ritalin</p>
<p>Jonathan Grover: mefanol??? mefadanol???</p>
<p>sees Chomsky as a neo-behaviourist in terms of not producing ideas that are powerful enough to explain linguitstic phenomena</p>
<p>pain asymbolia � lesion cingulate gyrus</p>
<p>discussing non-expressed genes:</p>
<p>difficult for evolution to weed them out</p>
<p>backups, residues from other animals</p>
<p>apparently the frugal fish doesn�t have introns</p>
<p>neither do bacteria, apparently</p>
<p>how did the foogoo(sp???) (zebra fish???) get rid of its non-expressed (introns) genes??? how big is its genome???</p>
<p>he doesn�t consider there to be a neuroscientific theory of LTM</p>
<p>he doesn�t think you can get very far bottom-up without some good architectural ideas about what to look for at the middle-level�</p>
<p>he asks: what�s a low-resolution representation of 1000 statements in English?</p>
<p>apparently adults can learn a new language faster than children � if you go on an intensive 3-month course � learning 50 words a day</p>
<p>the child has to learn the concepts at the same time, whereas adults already have them</p>
<p>there are certain things (like accents) that adults can�t learn</p>
<p>the adult is spending all day every day learning the language, whereas the child is presumably only hearing people every so often</p>
<p>harder to do maths in a foreign language (even if you learned it in your teens) � hmmmm</p>
<p>the numerals don�t change � perhaps it�s harder to relearn the associations</p>
<p>then what about people who learn a language with different numeral shapes???</p>
<p>refce: stanislas dehaene, �the number sense � how the mind creates mathematics� � apparently, argues innateness of the number line (for example) as a cognitive structure � that sounds very plausible</p>
<p>Minsky to his daughter � �if you do that, I won�t give you your allowance for 6 weeks� � �you�ll forget�</p>
<p>when people are hypnotised and someone�s telling you something, you can edit their memories � now, you can use hypnosis for clues, but not for evidence</p>
<p>story about a guy who hypnotises and asks his student to regress to 6 years old, handwriting changes etc. � then he tells the student to �pregress� 10 years into the future, and the guy describes what he�s doing, and the case he�s had that day etc.</p>
<p>flashbulb memory?</p>
<p>study asking people where they were during 9/11, but they were completely inaccurate</p>
<p>the problem with asking people about JFK�s death is that they�ve rehearsed their answer so many times</p>
<p>re Ron Hubbard and childhood abuse � they can almost never find the room that�s been described as where it happens</p>
<p>very hard to find reliable memories laid down before 5 or so (infantile amnesia)</p>
<p>most reasoning by analogy, rather than formal deduction</p>
<p>after, you construct a logical story</p>
<p>but he thinks that we are capable of doing logical reasoning</p>
<p>common sense knowledge has too many exceptions for deductive to be useful</p>
<p>deductive logic isn�t something that we�re good at</p>
<p>presumably we have a module that gets better at clean abstract deductive reasoning over a lifetime</p>
<p>I think he does think that we�re ultimately capable of deductive reasoning though</p>
<p>children don�t have a (uniform) sense of time</p>
<p>Piaget apparently didn�t write 2nd drafts, and is usually better in translation J</p>
<p>refce: read Winston�s thesis</p>
<p>interesting idea: use legal disclaimers as a source of common sense knowledge J</p>
<p>intelligence is when you see someone do something you want to be able to do</p>
<p>cs as all the things that don�t need to be said</p>
<p>the thing about IQ is that it�s relative to your age � explanation of the Flynn effect � could it be that if everyone�s maturing slower, their IQs will appear to go up??? does that work arithmetically???</p>
<p>how do they even compare IQs today with last century</p>
<p>Bettie Edwards � you can�t draw something you recognise � but you can if you just draw the spaces in between!</p>
<p>Galway � Inner tennis � don�t keep your eye on the ball, because by that time it�s too late</p>
<p>juggling � start with one ball, look at the top of the parabola, rather than keeping your eye on the ball � then you learn unconsciously to figure out where it�s going to land</p>
<p>untrained reflexes c. 0.2s, fastest athletes, 0.15s � false start in the 100m if you go before 0.15s</p>
<p>try to hit an imaginary ball 3 inches beyond the white (that way the extensors haven�t started to slow your arm down when you reach your actual white-ball destination)</p>
<p>pianist playing skips (large arm movements) � each hand covers an octave, with one octave either side, covering 6 in total, and the remaining 2 which don�t ever get used</p>
<p>he thinks there should be a good with 10 great tips for each field � hmmm</p>
<p>they might be good for boostrapping</p>
<p>but most valuable things are hard-earned � Piagetian??? Calvinist J</p>
<p>I�m skeptical about our ability to write down the things we learn</p>
<p>Ed Emberly � drawing tips, �Make a world�</p>
<p>he likes the idea of teaching vertical skills (that build on top of prior learning) in schools (where you can generate more and more complexity out of your building blocks)</p>
<h2 id="questions-for-today">Questions for today</h2>
<h3 id="rationality">Rationality</h3>
<p>last week, you said that the reason you weren�t troubled by Godel�s theory is that you consider the brain to be a formal system, but an inconsistent formal system</p>
<p>I don�t understand his answer</p>
<p>are we really �rational� animals??? what would that mean (if we�re inconsistent)???</p>
<p>doesn�t that undermine all thinking/philosophising/discussion, since we have no appeal to consistency as a rational authority???</p>
<p>rationality as more than just a Difference Engine???</p>
<p>you talk a lot about intelligence, but that seems like a much more creative, speculative, forward-looking process than rationality, which is maybe more of a checking, backwards-looking process�???</p>
<h3 id="general-cognitive-questions">General cognitive questions</h3>
<p>why do we make mistakes???</p>
<p>why would we have evolved to be completely rational � difficult/veiled truth is not adaptive???</p>
<p>why don�t you discuss analogy???</p>
<p>do you think it�s involved in learning???</p>
<p>he does discuss it � where???</p>
<h3 id="limits-of-our-knowledge">Limits of our knowledge</h3>
<p>why are some concepts more difficult???</p>
<p>perhaps because it�s difficult to find analogies for them???</p>
<p>do you reckon that we can understand ourselves???</p>
<p>how can our brains represent themselves???</p>
<p>perhaps by abstracting + devolving most of the difficult work to the simulations???</p>
<p>doesn�t it kind of rest on the naturalist premise that the world is describable and discoverable by science�???</p>
<h5 id="godel">Godel</h5>
<p>wrt Godel, could it be that we have islands of consistency???</p>
<h3 id="consciousness">Consciousness</h3>
<p>what happens if we put a hard disk in our heads � would it be conscious???</p>
<p>presumably he�d say that if it affects our agents it would be � hang on though, he couldn�t say that, because there are lots of causal events further upstream than my senses that ultimately affect my agents that I�m not conscious of</p>
<h3 id="common-sense">Common sense</h3>
<p>common sense vs intelligence???</p>
