<h1>Reading � Minsky, symbolic vs connectionist</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Greg Detre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Tuesday,
July 02, 2002</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>contemporary symbolic AI systems are now too constrained to
be able to deal with exceptions to rules, or to exploit fuzzy, approximate, or
heuristic fragments of knowledge. Partly in reaction to this, the connectionist
movement initially tried to develop more flexible systems, but soon came to be
imprisoned in its own peculiar ideology---of trying to build learning systems
endowed with as little architectural structure as possible, hoping to create
machines that could serve all masters equally well. The trouble with this is
that even a seemingly neutral architecture still embodies an implicit
assumption about which things are presumed to be &quot;similar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>'specialties'---for the the very act of naming a specialty
amounts to celebrating the discovery of some model of some aspect of reality,
which is useful despite being isolated from most of our other concerns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, the present-day systems of both types show serious
limitations. The top-down systems are handicapped by inflexible mechanisms for
retrieving knowledge and reasoning about it, while the bottom-up systems are
crippled by inflexible architectures and organizational schemes. Neither type
of system has been developed so as to be able to exploit multiple, diverse
varieties of knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Researchers in Artificial Intelligence have devised many
ways to do this, for example, in the forms of: Rule-based systems. Frames with
Default Assignments. Predicate Calculus. Procedural Representations.
Associative data bases. Procedural representations. Semantic Networks. Object
Oriented Programming. Conceptual Dependency. Action Scripts. Neural Networks
Natural Language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the 1960s and 1970s, students frequently asked,
&quot;Which kind of representation is best,&quot; and I usually replied that
we'd need more research before answering that. But now I would give a different
reply: &quot;To solve really hard problems, we'll have to use several different
representations.&quot; This is because each particular kind of data-structure
has its own virtues and deficiencies, and none by itself seems adequate for all
the different functions involved with what we call &quot;common sense.&quot;
Each have domains of competence and efficiency, so that one may work where another
fails. Furthermore, if we rely only on any single &quot;unified&quot; scheme,
then we'll have no way to recover from failure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>section 6.9 of The_Society_of_Mind &quot;The secret of what
something means lies in how it connects to other things we know. That's why
it's almost always wrong to seek the &quot;real meaning&quot; of anything. A
thing with just one meaning has scarcely any meaning at all.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Mary gave Jack the book&quot; this will produce in
you, albeit unconsciously, many different kinds of thoughts (see SOM
29.2)---that is, mental activities in such different realms as: A visual
representation of the scene. Postural and Tactile representations of the
experience. A script-sequence of a typical script-sequence for
&quot;giving.&quot; Representation of the participants' roles. Representations
of their social motivations. Default assumptions about Jack, Mary and the book.
Other assumptions about past and future expectations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we rarely use a representation in an intentional vacuum, but
we always have goals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we must also take into account the functional aspects of
what we know, and therefore we must classify things (and ideas) according to
what they can be used for, or which goals they can help us achieve</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The further a feature or difference lies from the surface of
the chosen representation, the harder it will be to respond to, exploit, or
adapt to it---and this is why the choice of representation is so important. In
each functional context we need to represent particularly well the heuristic
connections between each object's internal features and relationships, and the
possible functions of those objects. That is, we must be able to easily relate
the structural features of each object's representation to how that object
might behave in regard to achieving our present goals. This is further
discussed in sections 12.4, 12.5, 12.12, and 12.13 of SOM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what do we mean by &quot;close&quot; or
&quot;near.&quot; Decades of research on different forms of that question have
produced theories and procedures for use in signal processing, pattern
recognition, induction, classification, clustering, generalization, etc., and
each of these methods has been found useful for certain applications, but
ineffective for others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is time to stop arguing over which type of pattern
classification technique is best--- because that depends on our context and
goal. Instead, we should work at a higher level of organization, discover how
to build managerial systems to exploit the different virtues, and to evade the
different limitations, of each of these ways of comparing things. Different
types of problems, and representations, may require different concepts of
similarity. Within each realm of discourse, some representation will make
certain problems and concepts appear to be more closely related than others. To
make matters worse, even within the same problem domain, we may need different
notions of similarity for: Descriptions of problems and goals. Descriptions of
knowledge about the subject domain. Descriptions of procedures to be used. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the languages of many sciences, not merely those of Artificial
Intelligence and of psychology, are replete with attempts to portray families
of concepts in terms of various sorts of spaces equipped with various measures
of similarity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why have logic-based formalisms been so widely used in AI
research? I see two motives for selecting this type of representation. One
virtue of logic is clarity, its lack of ambiguity. Another advantage is the
pre-existence of many technical mathematical theories about logic. But logic
also has its disadvantages. Logical generalizations apply only to their literal
lexical instances, and logical implications apply only to expressions that
precisely instantiate their antecedent conditions. No exceptions at all are
allowed, no matter how &quot;closely&quot; they match</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Logic theorists seem to have forgotten that in actual life,
any expression like &quot;For all X$, P(X)&quot;--that is, in any world which
we find, but don't make---must be seen as only a convenient abbreviation for
something more like this: &quot;For any thing X being considered in the current
context, the assertion P(X) is likely to be useful for achieving goals like G,
provided that we apply in conjunction with certain heuristically appropriate
inference methods.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has become particularly popular, in AI logic programming,
to restrict the representation to expressions written in the first order
predicate calculus. This practice, which is so pervasive that most students
engaged in it don't even know what &quot;first order&quot; means here,
facilitates the use of certain types of inference, but at a very high price:
that the predicates of such expressions are prohibited from referring in
certain ways to one another. This prevents the representation of
meta-knowledge, rendering those systems incapable, for example, of describing
what the knowledge that they contain can be used for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Furthermore, it must be obvious that in order to apply our
knowledge to commonsense problems, we need to be able to recognize which
expressions are similar, in whatever heuristic sense may be appropriate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, we can think about much of Artificial Intelligence
research in terms of a tension between solving problems by searching for
solutions inside a compact and well-defined problem space (which is feasible
only for prototypes)---versus using external systems (that exploit larger
amounts of heuristic knowledge) to reduce the complexity of that inner search. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can we make Formal Logic more expressive, given that
each fundamental quantifier and connective is defined so narrowly from the
start. This could well be beyond repair, and the most satisfactory replacement
might be some sort of object-oriented frame-based language</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While logical representations have been used in popular
research, rule- based representations have been more successful in
applications. In these systems, each fragment of knowledge is represented by an
IF-THEN rule so that, whenever a description of the current problem-situation
precisely matches the rule's antecedent IF condition, the system performs the
action described by that rule's THEN consequent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if several rules match equally well? Of course, we
could choose the first on the list, or choose one at random, or use some other
superficial scheme---but why be so unimaginative? In SOM, we try to regard
conflicts as opportunities rather than obstacles---an opening that we can use
to exploit other kinds of knowledge. �</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Connectionist - In some instances, this has occurred without
any external supervision; furthermore, some of these systems have also
performed acceptably in the presence of incomplete or noisy inputs---and thus
correctly recognized patterns that were novel or incomplete. This means that
the architectures of those systems must indeed have embodied heuristic
connectivities that were appropriate for those particular problem-domains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>distribution may oppose parallelism: the more distributed a
system is---that is, the more intimately its parts interact---the fewer
different things it can do at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we simultaneously activate two distributed
representations in the same network, they will be forced to interact. In
favorable circumstances, those interactions can lead to useful parallel
computations, such as the satisfaction of simultaneous constraints. But that
will not happen in general; it will occur only when the representations happen
to mesh in suitably fortunate ways. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such problems will be especially serious when we try to
train distributed systems to deal with problems that require any sort of
structural analysis in which the system must represent relationships between
substructures of related types---that is, problems that are likely to demand
the same structural resources</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For these reasons, it will always be hard for a homogeneous
network to perform parallel &quot;high-level&quot; computations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>only answer is providing more hardware. More generally, it
seems obvious that without adequate memory-buffering, homogeneous networks must
remain incapable of recursion, so long as successive &quot;function calls&quot;
have to use the same hardware</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each connectionist net, once trained, can do only what it
has learned to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tend to forget how computationally massive a fully connected
neural network is</p>

systems</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perceptrons: The problem is that it is usually easy to make
isolated recognitions by detecting the presence of various features, and then
computing weighted conjunctions of them. Clearly, this is easy to do, even in
three-layer acyclic nets. But in compound scenes, this will not work unless the
separate features of all the distinct objects are somehow properly assigned to
those correct &quot;objects.&quot; For the same kind of reason, we cannot
expect neural networks to be generally able to parse the tree-like or embedded
structures found in the phrase structure of natural-language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This will surely need additional architecture to represent
that structural analysis of, for example, a visual scene into objects and their
relationships, by protecting each mid-level recognizer from seeing inputs
derived from other objects, perhaps by arranging for the object-recognizing
agents to compete to assign each feature to itself, while denying it to
competitors. This has been done successfully in symbolic systems, and parts
have been done in connectionist systems (for example, by Waltz and Pollack) but
there remain many conceptual missing links in this area--- particularly in
regard to how another connectionist system could use the output of one that
managed to parse the scene</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most serious of all is what we might call the Problem of
Opacity: the knowledge embodied inside a network's numerical coefficients is
not accessible outside that net. This is not a challenge we should expect our
connectionists to easily solve. I suspect it is so intractable that even our
own brains have evolved little such capacity over the billions of years it took
to evolve from anemone-like reticulae. Instead, I suspect that our societies
and hierarchies of sub-systems have evolved ways to evade the problem, by
arranging for some of our systems to learn to &quot;model&quot; what some of
our other systems do </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem of opacity grows more acute as representations
become more distributed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also makes it harder to learn, past a certain degree of
complexity, because it is hard to assign credit for success, or to formulate
new hypotheses (because the old hypotheses themselves are not
&quot;formulated&quot;). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, distributed learning ultimately limits growth, no
matter how convenient it may be in the short term, because &quot;the idea of a
thing with no parts provides nothing that we can use as pieces of
explanation&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But unless a distributed system has enough ability to
crystallize its knowledge into lucid representations of its new sub-concepts
and substructures, its ability to learn will eventually slow down and it will
be unable to solve problems beyond a certain degree of complexity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as networks sometimes solve problems by using massive
combinations of elements each of which has little individual significance,
symbolic systems sometimes solve problems by manipulating large expressions
with similarly insignificant terms, as when we replace the explicit structure
of a composite Boolean function by a locally senseless canonical form. Although
this simplifies some computations by making them more homogeneous, it disperses
knowledge about the structure and composition of the data---and thus disables
our ability to solve harder problems. At both extremes---in representations
that are either too distributed or too discrete---we lose the structural
knowledge embodied in the form of intermediate-level concepts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;thinking,&quot; requires facilities for temporarily
storing partial states of the system without confusing those memories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One answer is to provide, along with the required memory,
some systems for learning and executing control scripts, as suggested in
section 13.5 of SOM. To do this effectively, we must have some
&quot;Insulationism&quot; to counterbalance our &quot;connectionism&quot;.
Smart systems need both of those components, so the symbolic-connectionist
antagonism is not a valid technical issue, but only a transient concern in
contemporary scientific politics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consequently, I expect that the future art of brain design
will have to be more like sculpturing than like our present craft of
programming. It will be much less concerned with the algorithmic details of the
sub-machines than with balancing their relationships</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Furthermore, there will be a tendency for newly acquired
skills to develop from the relatively few that are already well developed and
this, again, will bias the largest scale connections toward evolving into
recursively clumped, rather than uniformly connected arrangements. A different
tendency to limit connectivities is discussed in section 20.8, which proposes a
sparse connection-scheme that can simulate, in real time, the behavior of fully
connected nets---in which only a small proportion of agents are simultaneously
active. This method, based on a half-century old idea of Calvin Mooers, allows
many intermittently active agents to share the same relatively narrow, common
connection bus. This might seem, at first, a mere economy, but section 20.9
suggests that this technique could also induce a more heuristically useful
tendency, if the separate signals on that bus were to represent meaningful
symbols.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�The statistical theories tend to uniformly weight all
instances, for lack of systematic ways to emphasize the types of situations of
most practical interest. But the AI systems of the future, like their human
counterparts, will normally prefer to satisfy rather than optimize---and we
don't yet have theories that can realistically portray those mundane sorts of
requirements.�</p>
