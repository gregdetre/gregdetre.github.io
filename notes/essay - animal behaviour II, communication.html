<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When ethologists use terms like �communication�,
�information�, �noise� and �deceit�, among others, they mean these in a
technical sense. Such terms are useful, because they give an immediate
intuitive kick start to our understanding of them, and yet they can later prove
obstructive �false friends�, usually through their anthropomorphising
connotations. Wilson (1975) broadly defines �communication� well for us:
�Communication occurs when one individual�s actions provide a signal that
changes the behaviour of another individual�. In this way, we can talk about
the �information� transmitted in the signal in terms of the extent and delicacy
with which one animal (the �signaller�) can influence the behaviour of another
(the �receiver�), or in terms of reduced uncertainty. We can talk about �noise�
in terms of attenuation, extraneous environmental distractions and any
deficiencies in the signaller�s encoding or receiver�s decoding equipment that
hamper or diminish the impact of the signal (Wiley 1983).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given all this, we can distinguish different types of
signals, with different purposes and adapted to different situations and
environments. In the case of the rufous-sided towhees (Richards 1981), an
initial burst of loud sound of unvarying pitch precedes the more complicated
warbling of the song which follows. This �alerting signal� notifies any animals
that can hear the initial sound to listen out for the sounds that follow, which
become degraded and muffled in the woodland (noise), and might otherwise go
unnoticed. Alerting signals are among the four features that ethologists have
identified animals using to increase the reliability of detection, including:
redundancy, conspicuousness, possession of small signal repertoires and use of
alerting components. The analogies between information transfer in animal
communication and in digital signal processing are quite explicit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The terms �honesty� and �deceit� seem ideally suited to
describing the behaviour and communication mechanisms employed by many animals
to increase their own fitness in some way, often at the expense of the receiver
or a nearby partial observer. As we will see, such �honest� or �deceitful�
communications are usually explicable in evolutionary terms, without reference
to morality or premeditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to consider how honesty and deceit arise in animal
communications, it will help to first look at a few examples of honest animal
communications, and to consider how these have evolved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dawkins &amp; Krebs (1978) put forward the case for
�manipulation�, where every communication balances the selfish attempt of the
signaller to increase its fitness, against the selfish attempt of the receiver
to increase its fitness. Thus, signallers are trying to influence the behaviour
of the receiver, and receivers are trying to gain information that might help
them. Hamilton (1964) presented this as a 2x2 matrix, ranging from mutuality
(where both signaller and receiver benefit), deceit, eavesdropping and �spite�
(where both suffer from the communication).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The means that signallers employ in this �deceit� are
varied, and take advantage of the receiver�s decoding mechanism in any way they
can. The most human-like deceits might involve simple Batesian mimicry, such as
a bigger or more splendid badge, plumage or display. These conventional signals
can take many forms, usually based at some point in the evolutionary past on an
assessable quality of import to the receiver. However, as soon as �cheats�
(deceitful signallers) realise that they can enjoy all the benefits accruing to
a great fighter just by wearing the badge, a sort of badge inflation occurs,
with bigger and bigger badges being necessary to display prowess. What happens
at this point depends on a number of factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the costs to the signaller of
producing the signal itself (e.g. handicapping signals, which might increase
visibility to predators)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the costs to the signaller of being
probed and exposed (e.g. losing badly in a fight);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the costs to the receiver of probing
the signaller (e.g. time, energy);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the costs to the receiver of being
deceived (e.g. copulating with an unsuitable mate).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These factors will determine the frequency of cheats.
�Probing� here indicates that the receiver has some means of assessing the
signaller in a more rigorous way than just decoding the signal. If the costs to
the receiver of probing are high, the genes to cheat will proliferate through
the population. However, this will lead to receivers being less trusting, and
the conventional system being undermined or devalued, until the receivers start
to probe more and more often. If the costs to the receiver of being deceived
are high, for example in choosing a mate who is a weak fighter or a poor
resource-holder, then the receiver cannot afford to be deceived. Finally,
Rohwer�s (1977) experiment with black patches on Harris� sparrows exemplifies
how the costs to the signaller of being probed and exposed may be high. Dying a
pale bird�s breast black to make it look more like a dominant male increases
its success in competition with other subordinate birds, yet young males have
not evolved to bluff by evolving larger black patches. The reason for this
seems to be that the dyed birds were persecuted by the real dominant males, and
presumably bluffers would pay the same price. In a similar way, young male
elephant seals (Le Boeuf 1974) who have evolved to look like females in order
to sneak past the bull elephant into his harem suffer costs from probing by the
female receivers, who emit loud screams during copulation, ensuring that only
the most dominant male nearby is able to complete copulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Guilford &amp; Dawkins summarise the range of signalling
systems which could all be described as �honest� to a greater or lesser degree.
These range from the most honest, where a given signal provides a perfect and
reliable (i.e. unbluffable) predictor for a quality that the receiver
particularly wants to know, i.e. provides important information. However, in
reality, such a perfect signal rarely exists, or has a prohibitive cost � the
very best way to find out which of two males will definitely win in a fight,
for instance, is for them to have a costly, full-scale fight. The case of the
red deer stags (Clutton-Brock &amp; Albon 1979) provides one such example,
where their roar seems to be an accurate, unbluffable indicator of fighting
prowess. However, often there are reliable signals which are correlated (again,
to a greater or lesser degree) with the quality that the receiver is trying to
assess, and these are used instead. These signals may have costs for both the
signaller and the receiver. Guilford &amp; Dawkins stress that most discussion
of deceit had not sufficiently considered the effect of the cost to the
receiver, usually in time or effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This extra pressure increases the propensity to evolve
towards conventional systems. These are potentially the least �honest�, given
that the signals are lower in cost and arbitrary, allowing Batesian mimics to
cheat extremely easily. However, there must be inherent safeguards in
conventional systems, otherwise they would become valueless over time as
receivers learnt not to trust the signals. Another type of unbluffable signal
is one where the costs of bluffing further simply exceed the benefits gained
from the bluff. However, the original emphasis placed by ethologists on
handicapping signals (Zahavi 1975) has since been undermined (Maynard Smith
1976).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blumberg &amp; Alberts (1992) strike a cautionary note by
distinguishing functions and effects when discussing adaptiveness in ethology.
They give the example of humans babies with respiratory distress syndrome,
where the baby emits little grunts with every breath. Paediatricians have learnt
to use this symptom to identify the condition, and so the grunt is clearly a
communication signal (by Wilson�s broad definition), though it is only the
acoustic product of a homeostatic mechanism. However, when ethologists have
observed similar laryngeal braking in the Norway rats (Blumberg &amp; Alberts
1990), and the mother�s acute auditory sensitivity in this range, they assume
that the ultrasonic squeaks produced are some sort of �distress call�. They
have confused an exaptation, the pups� involuntary ultrasonic emissions, with
an explicit signal whose function is to alert the mother, simply because this
time it is the receiver who has driven the evolutionary changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Axelrod &amp; Hamilton (1981) discuss the evolution of
honesty and deceit in terms of the age-old game theory study, the Prisoners�
Dilemma. Briefly, two partners in crime are being interviewed by the police,
separately. They each have the choice of cooperating by refusing to name the
other, or defecting, i.e. blaming the other. This results in a well-known 2x2
matrix, where the rewards are deliberately weighted such that dual cooperation
results in the best situation for them both. If one cooperates but the other
defects, the defector goes completely free and the cooperator loses out worst
of all. If both defect, then the rewards for both are somewhere in the middle.
Various strategies have been revealed, depending on the particular parameters
of the game. The results for one game are very different from the results for
many games. When playing once, the best option is to defect. However, when the
two have to play an indeterminate number of games, a tit-for-tat strategy
emerges, ultimately settling in cooperation. This mirrors ethological evidence,
where seemingly evolutionarily unsound altruistic strategies frequently emerge
amongst social groups, where memories of past wrong-doings are long, and the
entire genetic pool benefits from cooperation. In a similar way, honesty proves
the best policy in communications, though there are significant difficulties in
drawing analogies with the much more complicated situations that emerge in real
animal behaviours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wiley (1983) outlines these three scenarios of deceit in
animal communication as:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>escalation by counteracting
inflation and devaluation of signals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>mimicry limited by disadvantages of
incidental consequences for the signaller;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>mimicry limited by disadvantages of
increased discrimination by the receiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the first case, signals may inflate, perhaps becoming
unbluffable. Receivers may devalue, or become more discriminating (through more
subtle observation or more frequent full-scale probing). In the second case,
honesty is again enforced by costs directly to the signaller, unless some other
form of signalling more open to bluffing emerges. In the last case, the level
of dishonesty stabilises according to all the factors listed above, restrained
in signallers by the occasional probing by receivers, and restrained in
receivers by the costs to them of probing.</p>
