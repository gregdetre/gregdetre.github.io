<h2 id="reactions-call-tomasello">Reactions � Call + Tomasello</h2>
<p>It initially seems so intuitive that being brought up in a civilised, stimulating, human setting would be as beneficial for apes� cognitive development as for humans, but our intuition furnishes few details about which areas of cognitive development would most benefit, or why. We might consider that simply having a more advanced teacher would result in faster and more complex learning, just as neural networks trained by an advanced player learn much more rapidly than those trained against themselves. Similarly, humans may simply expose them to a wider range of objects from which to generalise, and new ways of manipulating them that are easier to be shown than to discover.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Call and Tomasello point out, most evidence of advanced skills being demonstrated in the wild is anecdotal, and debates about the extent to which teaching, motor imitation, deception and the like have been observed still rage. My feeling is that since such the evidence of such behaviour tend to be extremely rare, and always contentious, it�s more likely to be accidental or at the level of the physical stance, especially for high-level intentional behaviour like deception.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of the paper is that Boesch�s suggestion that apes display their most advanced cognitive skills in the wild is not supported by the evidence. However, we shouldn�t forget that Savage-Rumbaugh�s success with Kanzi may partly result from her use of 55 acres of natural forest, and activities and topics of discussions that are intended to mirror those of an animal in the wild.</p>
<h2 id="reactions-meltzoff-gopnik">Reactions �Meltzoff + Gopnik</h2>
<p>Gopnik and Meltzoff are interested in what the precursors and prerequisites to a fully-fledged theory of mind might be, and how they might lay the foundations for perceiving others as being and operating in fundamentally the same way as ourselves.</p>
<p>They argue that simply having an innate special attentiveness to the human facial pattern is insufficient for building the link between self and other since infants rarely see their own faces to see the parallel. Similarly, the adult-child �conversational dances� are not exclusive to interactions with people (after all, even a toy swinging above the cot takes turns to move after the infant has touched it), nor is it obvious how they might form a basis from which a theory of mind might develop.</p>
<p>Their theory is interesting. They argue that the foundation for our theory of mind is the primary perceptual judgement �here is something like me�. Going in the opposite direction to most theories, they propose that babies are in some way pre-wired to notice structural and temporal parallels between their own and others� actions. Simply put, babies can imitate and notice imitation (�cross-modal equivalences�) of themselves much earlier than previously thought. This important observation underpins preferential attention towards other humans, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Then they take into account the fact the findings (e.g. Eklund et al.) that simply making the facial gestures that correspond to certain emotions can trigger our feeling those emotions. Babies that pay special attention to faces and have some sort of innate ability to detect and reproduce the behaviour of adults are effectively mirroring the emotional state of the adults they are imitating. That this could develop over the long-term into empathy is a powerful idea.</p>
<p>Personally, it seems to me that the least plausible but critical step in their hypothesis is that infants have an innate means of mapping motor behaviour from others to themselves, especially facial movements. Motor imitation is defined as learning the operant task directly through the observation of the model�s behaviour (Heyes 1994, Zentall 1996). It is usually considered the cognitively most demanding category of social learning (for the observer), since it requires the translation of a visual input into a matching motor output which may involve more complex central processing than other mechanisms of social learning (Whiten &amp; Byrne 1988, Heyes 1988). As they point out, this perception of cross-modal equivalences certainly cannot be learned by infants as young as they are suggesting, so must be innate in some way. There is no a priori reason why we can�t have an innate means of mapping from a visual impression of others� facial movements to a motor command to make the same facial gestures. However, it does seem like a more specific and complex mechanism than we usually expect to find hard-wired, and it�s very difficult to imagine with current knowledge how it might be represented genetically or develop neurally within high-level architectural constraints. But these are areas we know little about, so perhaps our intuitions shouldn�t be trusted here.</p>
<p>I also want to mention at least one alternative to their hypothesis that ought to be borne in mind. When considering the mirror test as an indicator of self-recognition in primates, Povinelli points out that even success may not indicate genuine psychological self-recognition, but rather an extended motor self-concept. That is, they do not really recognise themselves but simply learn an equivalence between their behaviour and what they see in the mirror. It seems to me that when the infants are noticing adults imitating them (either structural or temporal), they might actually be believing that they have control over the adults� bodies in the same mysterious way they can control their limbs. That is, they might be including the adults� bodies as part of their own, like a more distant arm. This isn�t wildly different from what Gopnik and Meltzoff are suggesting, but there is something less interesting and persuasive if their claim was to be that infants� theory of mind is prompted by the realisation that they can have an (indirect) causal effect on imitators� movements, as opposed to the stronger realisation that other people are <em>other people</em> like them.</p>
<p>Finally, I don�t want to say much about their thoughts on autistic children. As they acknowledge, the scant evidence so far seems to support their claims, and the contrast with Down�s syndrome is worthy of note, but a longitudinal study that included young autistic children would say much more about how imitation and theory of mind might be causally related.</p>
<p>They could perhaps also point to the lack of strong evidence for motor imitation in animals (e.g. primates: Byrne 1995, Whiten et al 1996. Also birds, e.g. ravens: Fritz &amp; Kotrschal) as suggesting why animals fail to develop a real theory of mind.</p>
