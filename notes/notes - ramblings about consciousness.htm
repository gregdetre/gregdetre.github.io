<h1>Consciousness and dualism</h1>

<h2>introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that Descartes� most infamous declarations figure
prominently in every physiology textbook is a testament to the importance of
the issues he addresses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the same textbooks unanimously declare this to be
an outdated idea, in line with the prevailing modern view that the complexity
of the nervous system (and possibly the rest of the body) provides sufficient
explanation in physiological terms to account for the mystery of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>misconceptions (at least, they�re believed to be <i>mis</i>conceptions
<i>at the moment</i>) that have arisen from Descartes� thought</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�animal spirits�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>pineal glands</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>main</h2>

<h3>outlining the problem</h3>

<h4>primitive subjectivity</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>descartes� problem lies in explaining the inherent,
unavoidable and essential interactions � arguably, these are the very most
primitive of all � subjectivity is by definition what we feel, what gives us a
sense of existence, and most powerfully conveys the sense of substrate, the �us�
underlying that which makes us up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>larger issue � consc</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>what constitutes �mind� has changed since Descartes was
writing. doctors have been able to give a very crude degree of sight back to a
now-blind man, by providing neural signals (inputted at how high a level?
retina <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:
"Venetian301 Dm BT";mso-hansi-font-family:"Venetian301 Dm BT";mso-char-type:
symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;
mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>�</span></span> cortex?) which he literally
�sees� as basic contours. this perhaps closes the question of whether
physiology can adequately explain sensory input as continual processing of
signals received from the receptors. similar certainty can be attained for the
motor system, by stimulating areas of a topographical map of the body in the
(primary?) motor cortex, leading to stimulation of the respective muscle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>homonculus in a cartesian theatre with a very complicated
joystick</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>indivisible</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>there is something �unified� about mind, or at least our
minds � that is to say, we feel as though we are one, an �I�, a single
consciousness. yet, we are in fact 10 to the 11 irritable cells, or to put it
another way, 10 to the 15 connections between them, or to put it yet another
way, a flux of pulses (action potentials) along these neural pathways. the
�higher-order thought� theory of consciousness limits the definition by
granting �consciousness� to a mental state when it is able to consider itself
as the object of its own thought (report a thought, rather than an expression
of a thought (cf Hume�s �simple ideas�)) � can this be done by something
indivisible. on the other hand (now fighting against the materialists), if our
consciousness/mind <i>is</i> simply (built up of) the particular arrangement
and state of the particular neurons firing at any given point in time (cf
dispositions in Damasio), then how can a network consider itself? how can the
bank of neurons configure themselves to form a representation of themselves/their
own state? this problem does however, assume that it is the <i>entirety</i> of
the network which is being taken into account � in fact, it would make far more
sense if it were only certain bits, the final highest-level sections. after
all, why include the firing of low-level neurons like the bipolar neurons
stimulated by the retinal cells, when we have evolved to incorporate so much
processing into their inputs. by the time these signals reach the cortices,
they are barely recognisable as the same signal � in fact, the brain has coded
and compressed and extracted from the original signal to form a reconstructed
version � this is even further from the original by the time the �perceptual
idea� has become a �recalled idea�, as well as less vivid. the point is, that
only the results of the processing need be accessible to consciousness (but
then, once again, we�re moving away from the mind as being indivisible). <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Venetian301 Dm BT";
mso-hansi-font-family:"Venetian301 Dm BT";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>�</span></span>
un/non-conscious thoughts (the somatic marker and the gut feeling) � all make
things difficult for the �perfect transparency of mind�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can a network be �conscious� � would the �mental lights
still be out�, with all these telegraph poles linked together so intricately
and carefully, but no one there to listen to what�s being said? no one at home.
the homonculus, in other words. his point is that though a dog�s conception of
cat may be <i>extensionally</i> the same as ours, it cannot consider its
concept. languageless animal has no way of consdering cat or snow �in itself�
or �in general�. �no way of wresting concepts from their conceptionist nests
and manipulating them�, of voicing the polar bear�s implicit/procedural
snow-how (<i>wieldable concepts</i>). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>virtual
architecture</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is HOT recursive � is an HOT about an HOT third-order?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if we were to accept that the subjective unified phenomenon
of consciousness is just the state of firing of a network of neurons, then
obviously the bank of neurons, like the atoms in the corporeal world, can be
separated from each other - but this is a spurious objection � the actual
�mind� that they form as a collective would be unified, or would it? what
happens to it if you cut one of its neurons out of the loop? mind definitely
becomes divisible if we can separate the neurons into separate systems and
sub-systems</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what if we weren't in fact a unified indivisible entity
(/Cartesian theatre), as modern theorists are considering � what if our single
consciousness was built instead from a number of areas/modules, with their
separate representations being somehow united (by glue rather than a homunculus)
or brought together <i>in time</i>, would we still have self?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h4>working memory</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>as we learn more about the activity of the brain, the ideas
of Descartes� mind start to seem as simplified as his ideas of the body.
perhaps the simplest demonstration of a somehow parallel as opposed to serial
mind (is serialness actually necessary for a unified mind?) is the working
memory � the fact that we can hold more than one idea in our head (but <i>can</i>
we?) would seem to imply different areas working together. certainly it seems
that we rely on the �sketchbook� of our working memory with which to think in
the present � to hold separate concepts in our head, or at least juggle them
within the window/slice (larger than an instant � need for temporal summation
(like a synapse) rather than living purely in the present (like the cloud of
super-positions so that an atom exists probably around about roughly here)) of
time so that we appear to hold them all in consciousness at once (time-sharing,
giving the appearance of multi-tasking like a computer).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ecoic memory pre-working for senses info � much filtering
between memory modules � consciousness&lt;-&gt;memory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seems to be something different between a body�s properties
(basically just extension) being accidental (i.e. it�s configuration subject to
change over time) and a mind having different thoughts � what are a mind�s
properties � indivisibility/inextensibility and the capacity to have thought/to
think � I suppose that Descartes would argue that its accidentalness stems from
this thought/thinking changing over time, just as extension (the property of
extension, anyway) morphs and alters � but somehow thought isn't a malleable,
morphing plenum with strict delineations. which raises a question about whether
there exists vacuum in the body-dimension, whether there can be nothingness in
the corporeal world. but descartes says that nothingness has no properties,
certainly not extension. but it does, since what occupies the gaps between
atoms � this is perhaps too topical a question for philosophy or even modern
physics to answer at the moment, but it certainly seems that thought itself is
not indivisible. it must be, because Descartes talks of individual thoughts
(mind you, he also talks about individual, separate bodies � is that relevant?)
if so, this would seem to require some sort of mental membrane to sort out his
own from others�/not-his-own thoughts. how does the mind encompass new thoughts
if it is indivisible? is it something paradoxical like the universe: finite,
but boundless � anyway, thought seems to be more of a disparate set of
elements, much like the discrete combinatorial nature of language comprised of
its separate words � collectively, they shift, re-order, even re-combine and
flow from one another. the same word/thought can exist/be uttered/thought in
different places/by diff people, but still be one�s own � then is thought,
language? certainly not according to Damasio, who states that the subtle
manipulation of the images in our mind (he uses the term, �images� to comprise the
whole spectrum of sense modalities, substituting the more appropriate term,
�representations� also) <i>is</i> thought. does this settle whether thought,
like matter, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the mind thought, or does the mind think? is the body
extension, or does it extend? it seems uncertain now whether there is any
analogue between the two that can be made, at least not as a parallel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the debate now centres around the seat of consciousness,
since these sensory inputs and motivational mechanisms seem to impinge on us so
vividly and in a non-intellectual sense. by the same token, the problematic
area with regard to mind <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;

volition, the step �before� the firing of cells in the motor cortex. the
question is whether there is any sense in attempting to understand the subjective
phenomena of volition as a <i>cause of</i> rather than a <i>manifestation of</i>
the neuronal firing in the cortex which travels down the spinal cord and,
relayed by synapses, directly causes the muscular contraction.</p>

<h4>dennett</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>the consc thoughts are simply those which have lasted long
enough and acquired enough influence in the competition against all the other
subconscious thinking going on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dennett says that the main thing that sets up apart is that
we can imagine, provide our own internally-grown mental stimulation, work on
concepts held in working memory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>k�r�s monkeys may/may not have been able to cognitively
solve the problem of the stacked boxes or whatever (tell the story about the
monkey with its hand trapped in the small hole), but could they summon a mental
image � it seems likely that they were doing it by trial and error rather than
through concerted/deliberate manipulation of a mental representation of their
surroundings. dennett regards the question of the chimps� abilities in this
regard as being one of how their minds are put together, rather than simply
size or number of neurons. he extends plato�s metaphor of memory as being birds
in a cage, to ask whether chimps can make the birds in their mental aviaries
fly in formation, i.e cognitively manipulate their representations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pandemonium and the colour phi phenomenon (dennett�s
premise: information processing does not mimic the real time properties of
experience) � verifiable by experiments on <i>internal</i> cognitive dissonance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>awareness/attention, recall, keep track of &gt;1 thing,
which features of its own activity can it notice/monitor?</p>

<h4>valery</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>the purpose of a mind is to create future</p>

<h4>rolls</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>consciousness has evolved as a means of deciding between the
action that our emotional mode has put us in gear to do and the
future-generated consequences-based inferential conclusions</p>

<h4>hume</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>no impression of self, therefore no idea of self (banishing
substance from psychology, just as berkeley dismissed substance from physics)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also, when trying to centre on �myself�, he always stumbles
on some particular perception or other � I never catch <i>myself</i> at any
time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>manking is nothing but a bundle or collection of diff
perceptions, succeeding each other with inconceivable rapidity � in a
perceptual flux and movement</p>

<h4>monism</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>berkeley � matter exists simply as idea/ideas held in mind
(of man or God or any other mindful object/subject?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>physiology � body is capable of thought, that is, the
phenomenon of mind is explicable in terms of / caused by matter � materialism
in philosophy of mind</p>

<h4>damasio</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>consider �pathetic fallacy� with regard to the body�s (as
somatic marker) physiological-based emotions (<i>weather</i>) shedding
light/shadow (giving <i>value</i>) to the paths carved out by our
(options-generating future-calculating) reasoning in the landscape of the
future, enabling us to choose and make decisions</p>

<h2>conclusion</h2>

<h4>no, it doesn't</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>without our body, we would not have/be mind? (which is it?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>our mind is not indivisible</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>he hasn't coherently/compellingly

<p class=MsoNormal>I suppose all this is somehow redundant, since there can be
little doubt that the exact distinction Descartes drew between mind and body is
just wrong. but the question has evolved to become �is there any way that it
can be adapted, or that current or more flexible distinctions/definitions/ideas
can be fitted into the rest of his metaphysics�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this brings up the side-question of �to what extent does
Descartes� system depend on his dualistic interpretation�?</p>
