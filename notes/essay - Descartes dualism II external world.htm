<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:.25in .75in 1.0in 1.25in'>Descartes tend to
be categorised a rationalist, but this is a simplification, both of his
approach and his motives. On one level, his work can be seen as that of a man
trying to reconcile science and belief. He writes always of foundationalist
beginnings, upon which he can base a more coherentist framework of �scientia�.
But there is not really a simple dichotomy: rather the conflict is apparent
between the practical, empiricist, experimental leanings of his scientific mind
with the religious, ideal intellectualism in which he was brought up and
believed. Seen in this way, the aim of the <i>Meditations</i> is two-fold:
providing a metaphsyical grounding which will justify and hopefully further the
progress of human rational and scientific endeavour; and proving God�s
existence and lifting humanity above the animals by our souls and reason. Like
Newton after him, practicing science is almost doing God�s work, by employing
our divine sovereign reason fruitfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we talk of his proof of the external world being
�successful�, we might ideally like him to provide a conception of reality
objective enough to explain ourselves, animals and inanimate objects, thought
and the mind-body interaction and our perception of secondary qualities; in his
own terms though, success would be measured largely in providing grounds for
certainty in science, but a science explicable in divine terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Garber demonstrates that Descartes develops two alternate
routes in trying to climb outside his own mind and perceptions to explain the
local and subjective in terms of the more objective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his early unfinished Rules, Descartes describes a method
of scientific enquiry where a problem is reduced to a more and more basic level
until an explanation for a fundamental question can be intuited. From there,
the Enquirer/Scientist can deduce downwards, through intuition of the validity
of the inferences connecting the propositions, to the original issue. In many
ways this is a more satisfying explanatino of method than the free-floating
forward method of the <i>Meditations</i>, because it sketches out the path as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Garber uses the examples of the rainbow and the anaclastic
line to demonstrate the two-stage reduction then deductive construction. Since
they both involve the physics of optics, they are both grounded on the
intuition of light as a �natural power�. However, experimentation has been
necessary to limit the avenue of enquiry and to better understand and define
the question being asked. This is an admission that the external world is
sometimes accessible only on in its own terms. The theory then formed is
rational and grounded on intuition; the theory verifies the observations from
which it is conceived. Garber goes on to try and show that this is blend of
rationalism and empiricism is not paradoxical, though that is not our concern
here. The point is to contrast this means of establishing <i>scientia</i> by
grounding everything on the intuitable, with that of the <i>Meditations</i>,
which dives in at the first principles and tries to convulutedly ratify a
ready-made external world and truth criterion in one go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In major respects, the approach outlined in the <i>Rules</i>
is akin to the <i>Meditations</i>, because it too appears to take a
foundationalist view of knowledge, simply approaching it from a bottom-up
rather than top-down direction. Both approaches rely on intuited starting
premises as forming the base of the epistemic structure, with intuited
inferences to build up towards a scientific picture. In order for the method of
the <i>Rules</i> to be complete in its scope, there have to be levels beyond
what is intuited, so that the Enquirer/Scientist can extend his enquiry all the
way back towards first principles. Then, the <i>Meditations</i> could be
constructed in reverse but upon the same foundations. However, this approach
could have unforeseen consequences � if any intuition were to depend on any
other aspect of knowledge, Descartes could be trapped in a coherentist
structure, which may or may not allow him to rest everything on his foundations
of God and the Cogito. He also treads a dangerous line with his use of
experiment, when linking the phenomena back to its ultimate intuition; he gives
an example of how knowledge of other natural powers may be necessary in
deducing downwards about light, hinting at the need for some knowledge about
the external world already may be necessary in drawing the analogy. So the <i>Rules</i>
is useful perhaps for a scientist already confident about first principles � to
use it in the same way that Descartes uses the <i>Meditations</i> would be to
re-trace the same path in reverse. But this might not even be possible, since
the path of the <i>Meditations</i> is necessarily a circuitous spiral, while
the <i>Rules</i> forms a perfect pyramidal structure � the Cartesian circle might
prove even more awkward to resolve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In writing the <i>Meditations</i>, Descartes can be seen
then as recognising that there will always be an underlying unanswerable �but
why <i>is</i> it like that?� The intuition �light is a natural power� is not a
bottom-line. Thus Descartes� second route to proving the external world is to
start from the foundations: a relatively easy intuition of consciousness, from
which he over-extends wrongly: from �I am thinking, therefore I exist� to �I am
a thinking thing�, from thoughts to mind. Then he attempts to prove God, a
non-deceiving God who can provide his clear and distinct perceptions with a
guarantee of truth, and then the external world is no longer completely
disjointed from the subjective perceptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The discussion of the external world first requires
Descartes to describe his conception of it, not in perceptual terms, but in
intellectual terms. This is necessary in order for such clear and distinct
perceptions to be validated by God � but crucially, it is his conception not an
internal image which is perceived clearly and distinctly. I will discuss this
description, then the terms of the proof in turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Descartes concludes that he �perceives [the wax] with
his understanding�, he means that:</p>

</span></span><![endif]>and he has a conception of this particular lump of wax
as discernible, but shifting, bounded extension, and which is perceived as
currently having the secondary qualities of wax</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He comes to this clear and distinct conception of the wax�s
essence having dissociated it from the various ephemeral sensory ideas with
which we assume unthinkingly that we know the world. The senses can tell us
nothing about corporeal essence, since they change, while by definition a
substance�s essence is immutable. The essence of the phsyical world as
extension must be grasped by the intellect not the imagination or the senses,
because a clear and distinct perception of it requires abstraction from, rather
than production of, a malleable multitude (or even infinitude) of altered
images. This conception shows the essence of matter to be directly opposite to
that of mind, i.e. pure divisible extension. The secondary qualities we
associate usually with matter, e.g. colour, taste and texture, are less
quantifiable, explanatory and objective than the primary quality, extension, of
which they are effectively subjective illusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, there are considerable problems accepting this,
even if the argument behind it were solid � in fact, these objections could
almost be seen as an <i>reductio ad absurdium</i> attack on Descartes�
conception of matter.</p>

reality, this is what is left � simply a four-dimensional space-time continuum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:.25in .75in 1.0in 1.25in'>In conclusion,
Descartes� proof of the external world in the <i>Meditations</i> holds insofar
as you accept the cogence of the arguments and proofs presented before then.
That is to say that he has proved the existence of an external world of some
sort, one bereft of secondary qualities and characterised only by extension. On
inspection, he has really proved little more than the existence of matter, i.e.
that there are bodies of a corporeal nature which are the active external cause
of his sense-perceptions. But this description does not leave it open that
there is more to the external world � matter is extension, nothing more or
different. Though it appears to have been proven, this description of the
external world is an impoverished, unintelligble one to us � and as Williams
argues, an absolute conception of reality, were it attainable, might be less
informative than an objective, comprehensible one. With his self-defeating
acknowledgement that this external world need not, and does not, closely
resemble our mental representation of it, Descartes undermines our scientific
body of knowledge, which rests on experiments on secondary qualities.</p>
