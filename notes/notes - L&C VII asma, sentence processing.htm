<p class=MsoNormal>duality?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Words are not sufficient for language � their meaning is
altered and given huge extra dimension by being bound in a syntax</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But only if this knowledge is shared by speaker + listener =
grammar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why don�t we notice ambiguities? �time flies like an arrow�
could mean any of over 50 different possible meanings (all grammatical), more
if we are listening to the words spoken aloud one by one. it is because we rely
on contextual clues and expectations of what the speaker is probably saying
that we unconsciously filter all these out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grammar is simply a set of conventions, adhered to within a
given language community</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word order matters</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>politicians think that the public
don�t know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the public know that politicians
don�t think</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having said that, arranging the same letters of a word in a
different order alters the meaning � what�s special about grammar? the
difference is that grammatical correctness is determined by infinitely
generative rules rather than rote-learnt set, finite combinations stored in a
mental lexicon. the meaning of a sentence is constituted by the particular
combination of its parts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The gross constituents of a word, the phonemes, taken
together simply identify the word. the constituents of a sentence, the words,
all have a different function � they each play a different role, e.g. subject,
object, verb etc. these roles inter-relate. different languages use different
rules for identifying the roles each word is playing, e.g. English uses the
�subject-verb-object� word order; English uses the �noun-adjective� order,
which is reversed in French</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other languages use case-marking rather than word order to
indicate the roles that words are occupying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But often, a given sentence (especially as you hear it
word-by-word) might be conforming to more than one grammatical convention, or
some of the words may have more than one meaning � in such (frequent) cases,
the sentence will be ambiguous, i.e. there is more than one grammatical
interpretation of the sentence. For example, �time flies like an arrow�, could
be interpreted as time flying through the arrow like an arrow, or time flies, a
variant on the common house fly, having a penchant for arrows. Indeed, to the
listener, the problem of distinguishing words from the auditory jumble is made
more difficult since there may well be a person called �Anne Arrow�, or a rare
verb, �to flizelike�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, the only way to pin down the roles being played
in a sentence is by reference to the words� meanings. For instance, one can eat
a pizza with friends/family or with your fingers/fork or with extra anchovies.
The three senses are very different, and this is only signalled by their very
different meanings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>But sometimes, one meaning being
more <span style='color:blue'>plausible </span>than the other is not enough???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes though, the ambiguity passes unnoticed (at least
initially), with unexpected results:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>For those of you who have
children and don�t know it, we have a nursery downstairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Crowds rushing to see Pope trample
six to death</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And sometimes, it can prove very difficult to spot an
ambiguity, to the extent that we might decide that a sentence is actually
ungrammatical:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>If someone read this sentence
thought it was ungrammatical because it missed an �and� between �sentence� and
�thought� they would be wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key to understanding this is to realise that there is
someone who is <i>being read</i> the sentence, i.e. �read� is in the passive
rather than being the main verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that this mistake is made almost universally,
despite there being a correct grammatical interpretation, would seem to
indicate that there is a consistent preference underlying our grammatical
analysis that rules out the alternative to the extent that our first response
is to assume the sentence is ungrammatical. This mistaken reading need not
hinge on a word with two possible meanings, like �read�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This universal preference for one (incorrect) reading over
another may be invaluable in understanding each other as well as we do without
becoming bogged down in the possible ambiguities at every point. However,
theories of language understanding get engtangled in explaining phenomena like
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>It could be that we learn to prefer
certain conventions over others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Given that the less preferred
interpretations tend to require more complex descriptions, they may require
more complex, and so less obvious, mental processes too. We might automatically
plump for the simplest option</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>We might be opting for the most
frequently used constructions (which may also be the simplest)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Such a frequency-based choice might
depend on the frequency of a particular construction for the words being used,
e.g. �read� in the past tense is more frequently used than �read� as a passive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, counter-intuitively, none of these explanations depend
on the meaning of the word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Context plays a critical role in our understanding. Consequently,
it needs to be taken into account during experiments. Until Stephen Crain�s
work with relative clause comprehension and production in young children, it
was assumed that they were unable to differentiate between the elephant bumping
the giraffe and vice versa in sentences like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>The elephant <i>that a giraffe
bumped against</i> lay down and went to sleep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The elephant <i>that bumped against
a giraffe</i> lay down and went to sleep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Crain tried to get children to act out a similar story
with toy animals, he found that children were able to understand and use such
relative clauses, but only if there was more than one elephant. Taken in this
context, the roles of subject and object are being much more clearly signalled
by the relative clause, and the meaning was clearer to the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Various experiments in adult sentence processing were
designed to investigate whether some of the preferences described would be
affected by context.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Subjects� unconscious eye movements were measured with an
infra-red beam while reading for the first time:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Sam told the writer that he
couldn�t understand to get some help from a decent editor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our eyes spend more time on problematic regions, or return
to earlier parts of the sentence. The experiment was designed to test how
problematic the sentence was by analysing eye movements when reading �to get�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to have a control to see how our eye movements cope
with a less ambiguous sentence, separate measurements were conducted on eye
movements reading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Sam asked the writer that he
couldn�t understand to get some help from a decent editor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, �asked� replaces �told�, since it does not lead us to
think that �Sam told the writer [something of great importance]�. For instance,
we don�t ever say, �Sam asked the writer that [his new book was awful]�. As
might be expected, eye movements in the sentence with �asked�, where there is
only one possible interpretation, are different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if the ambiguous �told� case is embedded in a context
where there is more than one writer, and it is that particular writer that Sam
is addressing, then the problems on encountering �to get� are eradicated,
mirroring Crain�s experiment with children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, it seemed as though certain kinds of ambiguities
resolved themselves when the meaning could be distinguished on the basis of
context. Subsequent experiments have given frequency a place in the explanation
once more, alongside context and a variety of other factors. Experiments have
shown, for instance, that different verbs associated with alternative
structures but with different frequencies influenced the particular
interpretation chosen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>frequency of occurrence of the
different meanings assoc with each word???</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We find then that if one kind of information is missing,
e.g. context, we rely on other types, e.g. frequency of occurrence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But which takes precedence over which? surely, in a
connectionist model, it�s all probabilistic??? constraint satisfaction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spoken vs written. Written contains no ambiguity about what
individual words are, i.e. their spelling, allows you to easily distinguish
between similar sounding words. However, spoken gives you prosody (intonation,
rhythm, pausing etc.), which helps disambiguate the sentence greatly. However,
it doesn�t always help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does emphasising a word disambiguate a sentence, or does it
add alternative meanings? Possibly, it can do either. And does prosody analysis
come after or before all these other factors?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What sort of mental representations do we form? Do they
mirror the kinds of categories that linguists use? The answer affects the
question of which mental representations are more complex, which we said
earlier might affect our preference for a given reading over another. This
would require a mental representation divorced from the individual meanings
normally conveyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heavy debate about just what form such internal
representations of the �who-did-what-to-whom?� take.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Choosing between ambiguities is just part of the battle of
understanding a sentence by deciding which roles should be assigned to which
participant words.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc499499166">Chapter 8 � �Who did what, and to whom?�</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Words have meanings in the same way that objects around us
have meanings � we use them according to how they work and what they are for.
Driving a car, as an analogy, is not just a matter of knowing what its
components do, but also using them according to conventions to tell us which
side of the road to drive on, what to do at a red light etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>what about how to use the clutch
and accelerator together - are they part of the conventions too???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>words refer to things � sometimes they refer to other words
(e.g. pronouns), or they point to which of a number of particular objects we
mean (relative clauses)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>some psycholinguists talk to the universal (except Frisian,
and then only when no ambiguity would arise) distinction between reflexive and
non-reflexive pronouns as evidence of innate linguistic knowledge, although
children do take a long time before they learn to get them right consistently</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps it just stems from children�s early instinct not to
assign two words for the same meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how do they tell whether the subject reading the sentence

implausible, the longer it takes to read the word</p>

a wedding ring to ___?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Which horse did Bertie present a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Or Marta Kaus found that an

comes across a contextually implausible word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>In fact, we process the words as
we go along, and we assume after �which woman did Bertie present� that the woman
is being presented</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>So what does this show??? maybe
that �present� is used more commonly to present that thing to something, rather
than to present something to that thing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>We try to assign words to roles
as we hear/read them, rather than waiting until we have found the �gap� in the
question, which may only come at the end � this is why we sometimes have to
re-read a sentence, to establish new roles for words in the light of what comes
at the end</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike the him/himself universal clean distinction,
different languages have different rules about where you can form a question by
adding a gap. for instance, in German, one cannot have a gap after a
proposition, though this is often permissible in English. However, even when
these conventions are flouted, the sentence is easily understandable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These seemingly arbitrary constraints on what can and cannot
be done may reflect underlying, non-arbitrary conventions. Here is one example
of how this might work for English: usually, to interpret questions like,
�Which woman did Bertie marry ___?�, you try to identify which participant is
intended by establishing first what role it played. It should be possible to
see which word best fits the roles entailed by the verb. Finding the gap in the
sentence later will tell you which role should have come there, and this should
be enough to wholly disambiguate the roles of the entire sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This may help when we now look at examples where adding a
legitimate-seeming gap results in an ungrammatical question:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>What did she think Bertie�s
offer of ___ was long overdue?<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>The marriage that she thought
Bertie�s offer was long overdue took place last week.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In both these cases, the gap is in a position which does not
receive a role from the verb. The arbitrary-seeming rule can be seen in the
light of an underlying, wider rule, regarding how the roles are assigned by the
verb. </p>

<h3>Gleitman + Liberman, Intro to cog sci, Chapter 8, �Comprehending sentence
structure�</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are limits to the processing capacity of the human
sentence processor. For instance, almost everybody stumbles over double
center-embedded relative clauses like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>The rat the cat the dog worried
chased ate the malt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though this is wholly grammatical, we cannot seem to
hold the sentence structure complete in our heads. If we simplify, by naming
�the cat the dog worried�, �Socks�, then we find:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>������ </span>The rat Socks
chased ate the malt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>comparatively easy to process. The complexity of this
sentence can be seen in its very deep tree structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The processing difficulty of the original sentence is
exacerbated by its containing two �empty categories�. These are seen by
linguists as sections of the sentence that effectively exist, but are not
pronounced or written. The listener has to deduce the existence of and
properties of an empty category. An illustrative example is the sentence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>John flew to Paris, and Mary to
Chicago</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which contains the �missing� verb, �flew�, in the second
half of the sentence. This is an empty category, because the tree diagrams for
both halves of the sentence are identical, with an empty category completing
the verb phrase.</p>
