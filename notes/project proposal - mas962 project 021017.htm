<p class=MsoNormal>Sorry to have been dragging my feet over the project
proposal. Here�s a preliminary outline of what I hope might be interesting and
feasible to try. I would welcome any criticisms or guidance.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I started by reading some of Luc Steels' papers, but they've
been a bit disappointing. I like the questions he's addressing, and his
methodological framework (Steels, 1997, �Synthesising the origins of language
and meaning using co-evolution, self-organisation and level formation�,
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/steels97synthesising.html), but I suppose I'm
disappointed by how much he has to build in to his models in order for the
self-organisation to work. For instance, there's a paper in which he tries to
self-organise a spatial vocabulary within a language community (Steels 1995, �A
self-organising spatial vocabulary�, http://arti.vub.ac.be/steels/space.ps),
which works, but only within the crippling constraint of pre-specified meaning sets
that the vocabulary maps onto. The only self-organisation that is happening is
the mapping of the arbitrary vocabulary symbols onto the pre-specified meaning
set (of extremely basic spatial terms like �front�, �left� etc.), simply by
correlating referential 'gestures' with language-symbol 'utterances'.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�m still very keen to investigate the space-time
representation crossover that we discussed with regard to Boroditsky�s and
Regier�s work, but that has had to take a back-burner while I�ve been caught up
with other things. I realise that you�d like to keep that project and the
MAS962 project fairly separate, but since I have been thinking about space/time
representations a lot, I was hoping you wouldn�t mind if I considered that as
the domain for the MAS962 project.</p>

<h2>Sketch of the model</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the Regier &amp; Carlson �above� model is elegant
and rigorous, I feel that it might actually be more complicated than necessary
for the sort of hypotheses I�d want to consider first. I thought that it might
actually be possible to make progress using a very simple model, similar to the
one described in Steels (1995) that I mentioned above. The world would consist
of a 1D or 2D spatial grid, discrete timesteps, two agents and a series of
objects whose changing location they have to describe to each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steels uses the prepositions �front�, �left�, �right� and
�back�, but since I�m hoping to shift into the temporal domain eventually, I
considered that �near� might be appropriate, simple and fundamental. I�m
imagining �nearness� being defined as just the Euclidean distance from an agent
to the object. There would be some threshold radius, within which an object
would be considered �near�. It may also be necessary to define �far� as the
converse of �near�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I haven�t read that paper on the semantics of �in� yet, but
I mean to. I�m hoping that �near� will prove a less problematic notion than you
said �in� is.</p>

<h2>Possible directions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It might make sense to start with a one-dimensional world �
visualise a bridge � with the objects moving towards the agents from one side.
They take it in turns to be able to see the objects coming towards them, and to
shout a �near� warning to the other agent (one agent holds their shared
eyeball, while the other operates their shared pogo stick). When an object
becomes �near�, they have to �jump� for the interaction to be a success. Having
learned �near�, we might eventually have the objects come from both sides, and
use �front� and �back�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things get interesting when the speed that the objects
approach at can vary. At this point, the time-to-impact is no longer simply a
function of distance, but also of speed. This would allow us to either redefine
�near� to be �soon� (i.e. a function that combines either far-and-fast, or
close-and-slow, or close-and-fast), or to split it into two notions of
(physically) �close� and �fast�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�ve described things in this careful, limited-seeming way
because this seems like the most intuitive way to build a spatial
representation that could be co-opted into the temporal domain. I�m sure you
have a clearer idea than I do of how the Regier model might be co-opted into
the temporal domain, but I had a really hard time conceiving how it might work
at all, at least not without adding enormous extra complication. As it is, I think
it may be necessary to move to a 2D spatial world, but I thought it might make
things simpler initially if the spatial and temporal representations were of
the same dimensionality. I�m also initially only thinking in terms of the
agents and objects as points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also think it may prove necessary to allow the agents
freedom of movement in at least one dimension in order to see anything
interesting in the temporal domain, especially with regard to perhaps teasing
apart ego- vs time-moving representations. At the moment, this is little more
than a vague hunch, but it seems difficult to imagine how an ego-moving
representation of time would ever emerge without some notion of the ego being
able to move. This may have something to do with the fact that a distinction
between egocentric and allocentric coordinates only exists when one can move
within the world. I presume it will then also be necessary for the agents to be
able to move independently of each other, and to represent each other�s
position relative to the object (presumably in allocentric) coordinates. I
suspect that would be complicated, which is why I don�t want to introduce it
into the model until later.</p>

<h2>Connectionist representations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�m pretty keen for the representations to be connectionist,
at least for the most part. This is partly because I worry that any
predominantly symbolic representation ends up being spoon-fed its structure by
the designer, though I�m aware that much the same could be argued of
connectionist representations too. My preference for connectionism is also
motivated by an attempt to get away from Steels� use of pre-specified meaning
sets. His emphasis is on attaching the vocabulary to these meaning sets by
means of a self-organising population-wide convergence. I see this as analogous
to the way that bees� decision to move hive results in a population-wide
convergence very suddenly � this also seems to be the same sort of basic
self-organisation that Nowak et al. have in mind in their model of evolutionary
population dynamics (2000,
http://www.ptb.ias.edu/plotkin/EvolutionOfSyntax.pdf). One means of achieving
this self-organising of the meaning sets might be to use a reinforcement
learning algorithm, rewarding the agents when they successfully communicate and
avoid a near object, as a means of conveying the meaning of �near�. The
opposite approach would be to use a backpropagation net (say) with an explicit
teacher/target stimulus to convey the sense of each proposition. I can�t see
any obvious advantage to this over a symbolic approach, but it may prove the
most tractable way to start.<span style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Approaches, assumptions and contentions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just to defend some of the choices I�ve made
philosophically, the assumptions and contentions that I�ve tried to set out for
myself are as follows. I�m afraid they�re pretty vague at the moment.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�m interested in how the adaptive value of language shapes
its structure. The notion of �adaptiveness� implies an evolutionary framework,
so maybe it�s a misleading term to use. By it, I�m thinking of any approach
where the learning algorithm is in some way rewarded/reinforced, and that this
derived purpose anchors meaning. Eventually, I�m keen to explore the idea of
language games, as a means of exploring what sort of selective pressures (i.e.
different tasks) might have been operating to produce human language.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Much of this is drawn from Steels, amongst others).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Language is emergent/distributed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>There�s no centralised
controller or single language community leader, and you can�t have a single
speaker of a language. When we talk about �Language�, we�re referring to the
past and possible future interactions between its speakers. I�m hoping that two
speakers will be enough for the dynamics to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>It �spontaneously forms itself
once the appropriate physiological, psychological and social conditions are
satisfied� (see Steels, 1997).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>Language is too complex to arise out
of a generic learning algorithm or cognitive mechanism. There must be some
degree of specialisation or hard-wired bias to narrow the search space to make
learning the language tractable for new speakers. In this model, most of the
�hard-wired bias� will probably be in the form of my tweaking of the agents�
cognitive architecture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>Language is the tip of the cognitive
iceberg</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>You can�t speak a language
without a rich set of separable but densely inter-related concepts, that you
share to a greater or lesser degree with fellow speakers, and are grounded in a
shared environment and perceptuomotor mechanisms. Language and conceptual
structures are interwoven � they influence each other, but you can�t talk in
terms of one (wholly) determining or preceding the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>A language commmunity is shaped
by the experiences, limitations and the nature of embodiment of its individual
constituents. It follows then that you can�t have even a rudimentary language
without also having a functional, if basic, set of concepts and behaviours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>Language is combinatorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>We can, of course, imagine a
system of communication which does not involve combining units. For instance,
we can imagine some lookup table of arbitrary symbols, each of which stood for
some important �sentence�, and it might be pretty adaptive for its speakers,
especially if they had large memories and a basic&nbsp;or stable environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>However, our world is not
stable, and even if it was, it�s too complex for a lookup table to express
usefully without being enormous. As a result, we employ syntax as a means of
describing a potentially infinite number of possible combinations between
concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>So although there are certainly
non-combinatorial proto-languages, I can�t see how there could be an <i>interesting
</i>language that didn�t involve combination, or some analagous form of syntax.
Put in other terms, without generative rules that can be applied an arbitrary number
of times, the representative/expressive capacity of a language will always be
finite and impoverished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>At this stage, the questions
being investigated in this model are preliminary to the question of syntax, but
it may be possible to build up more complex messages such as �close fast
front�.<span style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>Contentions/questions unanswered</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whether communication is the main selective pressure behind
language, or whether there is some alternative internal benefit to being a
language-user.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>In this model, communication is the
major �selective pressure� for these agents. At this stage, I don�t see how it
would be possible to look at the extent to which the proto-language has shaped
the concepts it expresses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�d really like to consider how questions, statements and
imperatives arise and combine to form discourse, but I don�t think it will
really be an issue I�ll be able to address here.</p>

<h2>What I hope to show</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the very least, it would be enormously satisfying and
instructive to build a basic one-dimensional world model, even with a language
community of two agents, who can self-organise the prepositions �near�, (maybe
�far�), �front� and �back�. This wouldn�t be breaking any particularly new
ground, although I haven�t yet come across a paper that looks at the
preposition �near�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel that the project could take two directions at this
point.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>I
     could either focus on simple spatial notions, expand the world to two
     dimensions, give the agents freedom of movement in one dimension, and
     investigate whether they can form representations in allocentric
     coordinates. I know that the problem of converting to/from allocentric to
     egocentric coordinates is a big one, but there does seem to be some
     promising work (e.g. Andersen et al. (1997), �Multimodal representation of
     space in the posterior parietal cortex and its use in planning movements�,
     http://eye-hand.wustl.edu/lab/publications/pdf/ARN1997-Andersen.pdf). I
     would hope I could build upon this, and consider the problem of how the
     agents could then communicate instructions to each other, which would
     presumably require them to compute in coordinates relative to the other
     agent (e.g. �you�re to my right, and the object is near to <i>you</i>, so
     you should move to <i>your</i> left�).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'>I
     could focus on the cross-over from representing space to representing
     time. The best way that I�ve come up with of doing this would be to have
     the objects approaching at different speeds. I think this would still be
     possible within a one-dimensional world, which is why I chose near/soon as
     my central proposition, with front/coming as potentially a secondary
     proposition, to investigate. </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think that investigating the temporal effects would be
more likely to work, and might be potentially more interesting. However, <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I suspect that the most interesting
effects, like the ego- vs time-moving representations, would require a pretty
advanced cognitive architecture to be seen. Indeed, they must be contingent to
some degree on the particular way in which the human brain represents space,
time and movement, and I can�t yet see how to strip away the extraneous factors
to model them. If we were investigating time in a two-dimensional world, then
it might eventually also be possible to consider horizontal vs vertical
linguistic conceptions of time as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
