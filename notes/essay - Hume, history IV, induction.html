Allais, History of Philosophy IV</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I walk around inside my mind, amidst the �great, booming,
buzzing confusion�<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>, banging my
shins against furniture and watching the motion of the celestial bodies, David
Hume points out that these regularities upon which my life is based cannot be
rationally justified. Now, I look around with trepidation, wondering at every
moment whether the laws of gravity will cease to hold when I am in a lift, and
whether my opponent is going to thrash me in this evening�s pool Cuppers match
by turning my na� assumption about the predictable motion of the balls
against me. He points out that there is no argument by which I might know that
the laws of nature, especially of cause and effect, will hold true in the
future just because they have always held to my knowledge in the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to do this, he has to first draw a distinction
between what he sees as the two methods of acquiring understanding: relations
of ideas, and matters of fact. This distinction could be seen in terms of the <i>a
priori</i>, reason-based approach vs the <i>a posteriori</i>, experience-based
approach. Relations of ideas helps us in our logical and mathematical
enquiries, and allows us to deduce demonstratively necessary truths, but cannot
help us in the world of the senses, where we rely on moral and empirical
knowledge about matters of fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By �matters of fact� then, he is referring to whenever we
think we know about something (or someone), understand its reasons, or can
explain or predict their behaviour. This understanding is based upon our
inescapable, internal causal model of the world, based on a faith in the
uniformity (and accessibility) of the laws of nature. That is to say, our talk
of causality is intuited from regularities in the constant conjunction of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>events. At the root of all our knowledge
about the world is our Custom, the inductive custom, to assume that because
things have been a certain way in the past, they will continue to be in the
future. In Hume�s words, <i>�I have found that such an object has always been
attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in
appearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects�</i>. Every time an
event A precedes an event B, our expectation that this will occur in the future
approaches an even greater certainty. <i>�When a man says, I have found, in all
past instances, such sensible qualities conjoined with such secret powers: And
when he says, Similar sensible qualities will always be conjoined with similar
secret powers, he is not guilty of a tautology, nor are these propositions in
any respect the same.�</i> Here, Hume is demonstrating a different use of
induction, i.e. that because the properties of an object (which he terms
�secret powers�) give rise to its fitting into our causal schema in a certain
way, another object that resembles the first will behave similarly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem with this inductive principle is that, although
it has proved very successful in our dealings with the world, we cannot deduce
that the world should and will continue to be inductible. The inductive
principle is based wholly on experience, and no chain of reasoning can
demonstrate <i>a priori</i> why things should necessarily follow the particular
causal relationships we have come to expect them to. Any evidence from
experience (including scientific evidence) which supports or explains the
causal relations, itself begs the same question, i.e. it too <i>assumes</i>
that the future will resemble the past. It certainly seems that it must be the
case that induction is non-rational since peasants, infants and animals are all
perfectly able to see causal connections in everything around them. And if I
ask you to show me the chain of reasoning that you maintain affirms this
connection, and you hesitate or ramble intricately, then this cannot be the
same argument that all babes and �brute beasts� are so easily and intuitively
able to employ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The inductive principle operates very differently to
deduction. Deduction demonstrates necessary truths � on the basis of a
syllogism or a single instance, we can deduce that the angles in all triangles
will add up to 180<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;
mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'>�</span></span>, for instance. The denial of a deductive truth implies
a contradiction. Testing hundreds of triangles will not increase our certainty,
and if we were to find an exception, we would seek to account for it by an
error in our reasoning. In contrast, our certainty about an inductive truth
grows with every new instance we find that supports it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russell considers the problem of induction in terms of the
uniformity of nature. In exceptional-seeming cases like the sun not rising
tomorrow, science maintains the ultimate assumption that any general rules
which do admit exceptions will eventually yield to general rules which have <i>no</i>
exceptions. On this basis, we have been able to objectify our individual,
internal models of the world mathematically, giving greater power and accuracy
to our inductive truths, though without granting them any greater
epistemological weight. He also considers the argument that whenever we have
asked this question before, the future has become the past, and has always
resembled the distant past. But of course, just because past futures have
resembled past pasts, we are still no more certain that they will necessarily
resemble <i>all</i> future futures. Russell also notes that we should strictly
speak in terms of �fresh instances� rather than just the future, since uniformity
has to be universal in time and space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is Hume right then in claiming that we as philosophers have
no justification for our causal expectations? Well, we started by noting how
well we can function in our world, and it seems nonsense to ask whether we are <i>justified</i>
in employing a principle that is so clearly efficacious. But this is missing
the point. Hume is a pragmatist, and recognises explicitly Nature�s wisdom in
imbuing us with this automatic, non-rational mechanism for navigating our
world. But, as rationalist philosophers, do we have any justification, i.e. by
argument, for induction?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, any justification or argument for
induction cannot itself rely on induction at any point, so it must be
deductive, i.e. it must show that every inductively correct argument can be
converted to a deductively valid one without reference to experience. Thus,
Hume rejects the following argument that seems initially tempting:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(2) is the premise doing the most work and is the one that
Hume thinks we cannot accept without resorting to induction. On its own, (2) is
not self-evident, and it is not demonstrable (its denial does not imply a
contradiction), so the argument falls down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This would seem to lead us to inductive scepticism, so we
try and reject a premise, namely our assumption that �induction is rational
only if it can be justified�. This is what Strawson opts to do, by arguing that
�relying on induction is part of what it <i>means</i> to be rational, therefore
induction is rational even if it cannot be justified�<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
�It is an analytic proposition that is is reasonable to have a degree of belief
in a statement which is proportional to the strength of the evidence in its
favour; and it is an analytic proposition � that, other things being equal, the
evidence for a generalisation is strong in proportion as the number of
favourable instances, and the variety of circumstances in which they have been
found, is great. So to ask whether it is reasonable to place reliance on
inductive procedures is like asking whether it is reasonable to proportion the
degree of one�s convictions on the strength of the evidence. Doing this is what
�being reasonable� means in context.�<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This hinges on the statement that the strength of the
evidence is proportional to the number of instances and variety of
circumstances, which might be regarded as question-begging � for surely this
�analytic� proposition is already �[making] a normative claim to the effect
that inductive evidence is genuine or good evidence for a proposition�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He also argues (the �ordinary language argument�) that to
ask whether induction is a justified or justifiable procedure does not make
sense. He is attacking our notion of what it means for something to be
justified, or to require justification. By arguing that justification need not
be deductive or demonstrative, he is effectively arguing that the force of the
inductive principle is enough for it to be <i>self-</i>justifying. At one
point, he appears to be arguing that �justification� as we use it in ordinary
language <i>always</i> refers to an inductive justification, so it is no longer
clear what the question means when we ask whether an inductive standard itself
is reasonable, just as it makes little sense to ask whether the law is legal,
for instance. It makes sense to ask about whether particulars fit in with the
general principle, e.g. whether individual laws are legal, or whether a given
belief is justified � but to ask whether the general principle from which we
derive the reasonableness is itself reasonable � can <i>this</i> be reasonable?
There is no higher standard by which to measure the reasonableness of inductive
standards themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can we not simply reply to the ordinary language argument
that philosophy, certainly analytic philosophy, is the business of seeking
certain knowledge. Inductive justification is never wholly certain. Only
deductive knowledge can be. Therefore, when a <i>philosopher</i> asks the
question of whether or not a given approach is justified (other than
circularly), he is clearly seeking some extraneous, deductive proof � as Hume
clearly states. Yes, of course the principle of induction is reasonable, but it
is not <i>rational</i>. After all, if it was only inductive proof that
philosophy required, we would be back to natural philosophy, rather than
rationalism, and metaphysics would boil down to physics, and there would be no
difference in epistemic status between my opinion of what colour a pair of
trousers is as opposed to an analytic proposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The entire discussion really ranges around the epistemic
status of inductive truths. They seem to be somewhere in between deductive and
purely empirical truths, since they rest securely and successfully on the
internalist criteria of coherence and internal consistency in our world view.
Indeed, it almost seems as though Hume prefers them to reason, insofar as they are
not subject to error and are immediate and reliable. After all, what is there
to elevate our reason above Custom other than the force, liveliness and
steadiness of its conclusions?</p>
