<h1 id="lecture-society-of-mind">Lecture � Society of mind</h1>
<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, February 12, 2003</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>common sense as common conclusions?</p>
<p>most of Piaget�s conclusions have been borne out, despite only having 3 subjects, even that children don�t have a real sense of number till 5 or 6</p>
<p>just because birds get agitated if they return to their nest and there�s only 2 rather than 3 eggs left doesn�t mean that they can count</p>
<p>he had read that children don�t recognise faces until c. 6 months (recognise people�s speech by 3 months), until saw an experiment</p>
<p>infants of 1 week get excited when their mothers come into the room, but it turned out to be just the hairdo</p>
<p>the emotion machine never mentions neurology</p>
<p>doesn�t want to cite evidence that will probably be discredited soon</p>
<p>ch on credit assignment � part of the reason that people can learn so much faster than other animals</p>
<p>he�s been trying to convince NASA to have unmanned space stations � 1/10 of the cost � 3 robots, so that they can fix each other, do experiments, and send back results � but they�re convinced that the public won�t support unmanned space exploration</p>
<p>string � �you can�t push things with a string�</p>
<p>qualitative physics � ben kuijpers(sp???) �</p>
<p>emotions as selecting out and restricting thought � it�s rationality that�s hard</p>
<p>why don�t we call �hunger� etc. an emotion?</p>
<p>emotion as a big suitcase of ideas</p>
<p>he does view emotion as flexible behavioural strategies, I think</p>
<p>anger isn�t just an inhibition of censors and restriction of ways of thinking � it does make you think new things� but how could you tell if those �new things� are just unconscious all the while�???</p>
<p>improved reactions�</p>
<p>but emotions aren�t that low-dimensional, and they needn�t really be global!!! hmmm. maybe.</p>
<p>free will as a pernicious idea � free will is not a way to make a decision � it�s more like �my decision process has come to an end. it selected this particular option. I have no idea about how that was done.�</p>
<p>a smart robot will need to be able to:</p>
<p>remember what you�ve recently done</p>
<p>make descriptions of those events</p>
<p>reflect on what you <em>should</em> have done</p>
<p>make and using models of yourself</p>
<p>describe yourself as an entity</p>
<p>evaluate your various options</p>
<p>envision what would happen if</p>
<p>formulate new goals and plans</p>
<p>hear conversations in your mind</p>
<p>make descriptions of your ideas</p>
<p>recognise your level of wakefulness</p>
<p>notice some things, but not others</p>
<p>represent your emotional state</p>
<p>represent your body�s condition</p>
<p>he wouldn�t acknowledge what we might mean by conscious experience/qualia � what could there be besides the computation, he says?</p>
<p>but I can point to what I mean by consciousness by pointing to the boundary outside me of things I�m not conscious of</p>
<p>the thing about emergent properties is that you can predict all of the emergent properties � the barrier is epistemological, one of difficulty</p>
<p>Hameroff conjectures that neurons have global quantum state</p>
<p>�consciousness is the popular name for our single most serious limitation: that our top-level representations depict such a very small fraction of each situation�</p>
<p>he considers that Hume, Kant and Descartes� ideas on the workings of the mind are the sort of thing that you�d give a freshman an �A� for and a senior a �D� :)</p>
<p>can�t account for why Piaget�s discoveries were so late � did everyone just agree that children were little people???</p>
<p>in contrast, Galileo lacked the tools to formulate his evidence as an inverse square law</p>
<p>if you�re going to blame religion for holding science back, why didn�t anything happen between Archimedes and 430�</p>
<p>Twain: �The way to make money is to buy stocks when they�re cheap and sell them when they�re expensive. If they don�t go up, don�t buy them.�</p>
<p>unlike animals, we think a lot about internal problems:</p>
<p>some obstacle is in the way</p>
<p>my goal didn�t achieve its supergoal</p>
<p>I don�t have access to knowledge I need</p>
<p>one of my predictions has failed</p>
<p>two of my goals seem to be incompatible</p>
<p>I cannot get this method to work</p>
<p>more self-reflective</p>
<p>this problem is too hard</p>
<p>I have too many goals</p>
<p>I don�t have any worthwhile goals</p>
<p>he wants to know if anyone has thought about the kind of problems</p>
<h2 id="questions-to-ask-minsky">Questions to ask Minsky</h2>
<p>see questions doc</p>
<h2 id="questions-to-read-up-on">Questions to read up on</h2>
<p>what does he say about mental effort???</p>
<p>a kind of currency between agents</p>
<p>why do they need currency if they work in parallel??? that�s just the implementation though�</p>
