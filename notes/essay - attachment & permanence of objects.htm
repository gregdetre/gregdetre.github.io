permanence and attachment.</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Bowlbyï¿½s work after the war that began the swing away
from the behaviouristsï¿½ notion that babies depend on the adults around them
purely for physical nourishment. It is this need for a secure base which
underpins infantsï¿½ astounding ability to assimilate sensory information into a
coherent picture of their environment, which eventually extends to a
comprehension of the independent and permanent existence of objects around them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><a name="_Toc465010229"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010229'>ï¿½Attachmentï¿½, i.e.
the successful social relationships which children form, especially with their
parents, can be understood in terms of evolutionary psychology as simply a
means for the infant to make itself more attractive to those on whom it depends
completely for survival.</span></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010229'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc465010231"><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Robertsonï¿½s</i>
film of a two-year old girlï¿½s unhappiness at being separated from her mother
when taken to hospital led <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bowlby </i>to
theorise a three-part sequence of distress followed by protest and apathy.</a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010231'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc465010232">His ensuing work with the ï¿½forty-five
thievesï¿½, a group of delinquents of which an unusually large number came from
broken homes or had endured periods of separation from their parents, led him
to his conclusions about monotropy. He later developed this ground-breaking
assertion that early attachment to one particular person is important because
it provides children with love; he cited affectionless psychopathy as one
possible (and extreme) long-term consequence of a lack of a good relationship,
usually with the infantï¿½s mother, in the early years. </a></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010232'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc465010233">Bowlbyï¿½s work proved tremendously
influential, as well as benefiting from a variety of animal-based work, such
as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½ </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Lorenzï¿½s
</i>memorable demonstrations of irreversible imprinting in ducklings. Bowlbyï¿½s
acceptance of the idea of strong innate drives for social contacts with parents
drew weight from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Harlowï¿½s </i>work with
very young Rhesus monkeys (which are statistically one of the species closest
to man genetically, although this alone is not sufficient to vindicate direct
comparison across species). The monkeys were separated from their mothers and
given a choice between two artificial mothers, one with a wire teat providing
food representing physical sustenance while the other gave visual and tactual
support. The monkeysï¿½ obvious preference for the cloth mother, to which Harlow
ascribed the role of a ï¿½secure baseï¿½, prompted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ainsworthï¿½s </i>ï¿½strange situationï¿½ as an attempt to objectively
measure the quality of a mother/infant relationship.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010233'>Ainsworth believed
that the infantï¿½s primary motivation is for security, which it obtains through
a range of successful or unsuccessful relationships, and she posited four
criteria of a secure attachment:</span><span style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc465010239">Her strange situation, involving a
sequence of events leaving a baby in an alien environment with and without its
mother and/or a stranger, led her to classify three groups of babies: the
anxious-avoidant; securely-attached; and the anxious-ambivalent. This gradation
led to a reassessment of the position that itï¿½s not simply a traumatic
separation, but the whole range and quality of infant attachments which affects
adult life</a>, through work such as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bremnerï¿½s</i>,
who showed that eighteen-month old securely-attached children are more
independent in the classroom at four years old, as well as other evidence
linking the way the mothers behave with the childï¿½s group.<a
name="_Toc465010241"> </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010241'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bretherton </i>used a different technique to
provide implicit evidence of a trusting relationship between mother and child,
by telling a story with concrete material identifying the child with one of the
characters. When the ï¿½motherï¿½ character returns, and the child is asked ï¿½what
happened next?ï¿½, Bretheron used the responses to demonstrate trust in the
mother-figure to protect the child-character.</span></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc465010241'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ainsworth continued her work with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Bell</i> by demonstrating a negative correlation between the number of
episodes when the mother responds to the infantï¿½s crying to the frequency of
the babyï¿½s crying. This provided much-needed evidence to confront the
behavioural theory that picking children up reinforced their crying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><a name="_Toc464447504"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc464447504'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Piaget</i> became interested in how the
nature of childrenï¿½s understanding of the physical and social world around them
changes as they grow older, arguing that young children construct their
knowledge through interaction with their environment, based on certain built-in
behaviours (reflexes) such as looking, sucking and moving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc464447504'>He defined five
stages of development, starting from the first six months of life during which
babies first conceive a difference between themselves and objects around them.
However, they do not yet understand that objects have a continuous and
independent existence, and still live in a capricious unpredictable world
filled with objects which are dependent on their own actions.</span></p>

<span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc464447504'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc464447505">By stage 3, usually reached between
six and nine months, the baby displays interest in a variety of objects and
have developed a repertoire of movements. They perform the ï¿½not searchingï¿½
error, by which it is meant that they lose interest in a covered object because
they do not understand that the covered object still exists, and even if they
retrieve a partially-covered object, Piaget argues that they somehow believe

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc464447506">By stage 4, even though they will
retrieve an object which they have seen being partially covered, having been
habituated to finding it in place A, they will display comical surprise to find
that it is not still there even after having seen it being visibly removed to
place B. This, the ï¿½A not B errorï¿½ of searching in the wrong place, indicates
to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Piaget</i> a greater but still
imperfect understanding as they seem to understand a covered object as being a
ï¿½thing of the placeï¿½.</a><a name="_Toc464447507"> Although the phenomenon of
the AB error is not in dispute, there are alternate explanations, such as an
inability of the babyï¿½s to actually uncover the object, despite knowing of its
hidden existence. Bower and Baillargeon looked at the babyï¿½s heart rate and
surprise respectively in different experiments to try and determine whether the
babyï¿½s difficulty was simply one of knowing how to uncover the object. In order
to do this, Baillargeon measured the differences in the length of time babies
spent gazing at an ostensibly impossible/possible event, working on the premise
that babiesï¿½ gaze is an indicator of their interest (in this case based on the
preference for novelty) in an object. His results indicated that they looked
consistently more at the impossible events where an object appeared to have
disappeared, indicating surprise and consequently a conception of its
permanence, all of which goes against Piagetï¿½s explanation. Butterworthï¿½s work,
exposing the assumption that the AB error was somehow linked to the infantï¿½s
misconception of permanence showed that the mistake is still made when the
object is not hidden or covered in its container, but remains wholly visible.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bookmark:_Toc464447507'>At stage 5, after
approximately a year, the child no longer makes the AB error but does not yet
make inferences about invisible displacement, i.e. where an object of known
placement is surreptitiously swapped into a different container.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Baillargeon is right, stage 3 babies do have an
understanding of the continued existence and solidity of hidden objects, but
this still does not fully resolve Piagetï¿½s explanation about their conception
of objects independent of their own actions because the drawbridgeï¿½s movement
required no input from the observing baby. Although some degree of unceratinty
remains concerning the AB error and explanations of the later stages, it does
seem reasonable to delineate infantsï¿½ development into certain obvious
behavioural stages; however, inferences considering the cognitive development
giving rise to the infantsï¿½ curious relationship to its environment are
inevitably more debatable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With respect to attachment, Bowlbyï¿½s ideas about the
importance of stable relationships certainly played a vital role in moving
social psychology away from its behaviourist stance in the ï¿½60s. As to the
strange situationï¿½s attempts at an object measure of attachment, although it
could be partly a measure of personality as well as strength of the
mother-child relationship, it too goes a considerable distance towards
enhancing our understanding of the features and significance of infant
attachment.</p>
