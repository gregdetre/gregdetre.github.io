<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 12, 2003</p>
<p>do spicy foods activate your pain or your temperature receptors?</p>
<p>why do we have feelings at all, as opposed to being zombie machines?</p>
<p>just because you can imagine a person without feelings, doesn�t mean that that�s evidence for something</p>
<p>after all, how can you really imagine that, when you have no idea how (and can�t imagine how) a person works at all?</p>
<p>what about the people who think they don�t have any feelings?</p>
<p>called alexathemia(sp???)</p>
<p>and if you can�t imagine something, that�s just because you have too weak a imagination</p>
<p>when he imagines people with totally flat emotional affect, he thinks their cascades don�t work</p>
<p>he thinks feelings are how your various self-models describe your activities � they�re not primitive</p>
<p>pain, rather than being atomic, is difficult to talk about because it�s a linguistic shortcut for something very complicated spread over so many different brains systems</p>
<p>apparently, there�s a narrow band of frequency of laughing, and if you laugh at that frequency you start to find things funny</p>
<p>different theories of emotion:</p>
<p>james-lange � I�m happy because I smile etc.</p>
<p>emotions as the valencies (presumably of reward) attached to cognitive things</p>
<p>emotions as the kind of thinking that you use when you�re facing a conflict that needs to be resolved</p>
<p>reference: <em>How to Solve it</em> , <em>Induction and analogy in mathematics</em></p>
<p>Poincare (<em>Science and hypothesis</em> , late 19th century, pre-Freud) � mechanics, topology � gets mentioned in ch 7</p>
<p>Poincare discusses preparation, unconscious, revelation (looking for patterns that indicate a solution, set up in preparation phase), criticism/evaluation</p>
<p>seems to ascribe importance to the unconscious process that works in the background � but he then debunks it on the next page</p>
<p>what should they teach children in elementary school about thinking???</p>
<p>doesn�t know � some skills you practice little by little �</p>
<p>give them really hard problems, then give them hints � rather than problems that are carefully-graded in difficulty</p>
<p>the most important thing to teach is enjoying getting a wrong solution and finding out exactly why it�s wrong</p>
<p>two alternative types of school</p>
<p>montessouri � start early with mathematical types of problem</p>
<p>kid started to build with these arithmetic blocks and the teacher said �no, those aren�t toys� J</p>
<p>waldorf � less structured, explore creativity</p>
<p>synectics � brainstorming company in Boston</p>
<p>start by just freewheeling crazy ideas, then critical, then split into groups</p>
<p>most people may go through these in microphases, a few every second</p>
<p>his theory is that manic-depressives� cycles of these are skewed</p>
<p>some psychologists try to get people to talk out loud about their thought processes, e.g. while packing clothes into a suitcase</p>
<p>but getting people to try and speak out loud about their unconscious processes is a bad method of testing people</p>
<p>where do people have their best ideas?</p>
<p>intoxicated in a bar, and on the toilet</p>
<p>locked up in a room, and in social isolation</p>
<p>Minsky: gets ideas in the shower, perhaps because of sensory deprivation (noise of the shower)</p>
<p>you need to brainstorm at different levels � spend at least a few minutes a day looking at the big picture</p>
<p>Don Norman</p>
<p>fired by Apple � why???</p>
<p>finding things wrong with OS 9 � Minsky thinks they�ve been made worse</p>
<p>he doesn�t like the dock</p>
<p>aliasmenus, even better than fruit menus</p>
<p>in hard sci-fi, you�re only allowed one invention, and then you spend the time working out its implications � you�re more likely to get something useful if you only break one rule</p>
<p>Inspiration � mind-mapping package</p>
<p>Fitzgerald-Lorenz contraction came before the Theory of Relativity � but they considered it just a fudge factor whereas he took it seriously</p>
<p>Clarke eventually gave up on the space elevator because of terrorism</p>
<p>the reason that Godel�s theorem isn�t a problem is because it only applies to <em>consistent</em> formal systems � so if the brain is algorithmic, but <em>in</em> consistent</p>
<p>certainty vs truth</p>
<p>maths as consensus until someone points out an error</p>
<p>an algorithmic mind/machine throws out lots of true statements about mathematics, and a few false ones</p>
<p>defines a formal system as set of expressions and a set of rules to transform them</p>
<p>all of maths as proving tautologies</p>
<p>build an inconsistent formal system on top of a consistent system</p>
<p>he says that there�s lots of bits of tEM that should be taken out because they�re only there to irritate people J</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>minsky's talk of pain-behaviour as not needing to feel painful is surely nonsense - it allows implicitly for the idea that there are some behaviours that are/aren't conscious</p>
<p>i feel as though his claim that consciousness is not one-dimensional is either very right, or very wrong</p>
<p>let�s say we did build this extra system that served the same function that our pain-system serves now � wouldn�t that be conscious too???</p>
<p>well, as long as the higher levels are able to reason about it, certainly</p>
<p>perhaps assume it�s kind of like pain asymbolia</p>
<p>are the people with pain asymbolia motivated to avoid the pain though???</p>
<p>he says apparently not</p>
<p>does he have a cutoff point for which levels are conscious and which aren�t???</p>
<p>almost certainly not, because he wants to say that consciousness is not only a continuum (presumably), but multi/high-dimensional, and that any cutoff point would be terminological</p>
<p>is there more to suffering??? is it a unitary feeling???</p>
<p>presumably he�d say that the nature of your suffering depends on the nature of the constriction placed upon your thought processes???</p>
<p>is it an epiphenomenon??? is it designed into the system???</p>
<p>how does he argue for our multiple selfs all feeling like a <em>single</em> self (I�ve forgotten)???</p>
<p>emotions are just ways of thinking � but there are lots of ways of thinking that aren�t emotions</p>
<p>question: emotions as ways of thinking that activate your autonomic system � </p>
<p>Minsky: but where does the autonomic system start?</p>
<p>reference: Damasio on anasognosics</p>
<p>apparently Christopher Reeve can breathe for 30-40 mins at a time</p>
<p>he�s currently interested in trying to classify things we don�t have names for</p>
<p>e.g. the principle 50 critics that we use for �</p>
<p>teach them AI so that you can pin down the different types of frustration, anger, and the particular critics</p>
<p>interesting that there�s no word for these critics</p>
<p>would you expect to find these kind of domain-general critics though???</p>
