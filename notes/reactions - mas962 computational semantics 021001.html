<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p><em>1. Summarize the main ideas of each paper (one page maximum for each summary).</em></p>
<p><em>2. Download WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/). Choose five interesting pairs of words and find sequences of WordNet relations that connect each word pair.</em></p>
<h2 id="miller-introduction-to-wordnet">Miller, �Introduction to Wordnet�</h2>
<p>Miller describes Wordnet as �an on-line lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, and adjectives are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.�</p>
<p>We can attribute various aims to the Wordnet enterprise. The two most important seem to have been to a) harness modern computational power to create a more convenient word catalogue that shared some of the properties of a thesaurus and a dictionary, as well as incorporating new useful features of its own; b) structure its relations so that they behave analogously to human lexical memory, presumably in the hope that this would be useful for AI and NLP systems.</p>
<p>Because Miller considers �the starting point for lexical semantics � to be the mapping between forms and meanings�, Wordnet incorporates both syntactic (e.g. part of speech) and semantic (e.g. synonyms, is-a-kind-of, is-a-part-of and is-one-way-to hierarchies) information. Further useful information is also available, such as word commonality (measured in terms of polysemy), sentence frames and dictionary definition glosses. The system allows you to traverse effortlessly up, down and across the tree of all the words of the English language structured by whichever relation you choose.</p>
<p>The paper briefly discusses the representations used for nouns and their relations to each other and words from other syntactic categories. Probably the most interesting is their approach to broadly pinning down the �meaning� of a noun. Although glosses are provided (and often sample sentences too), the aim of Wordnet is not to try and provide enough information for a system to be able to learn the meanings of all the words in the English language from a rudimentary base. Rather, it is hoped that just enough information is provided to allow a fluent English speaker to easy tell one word/sense from another.</p>
<p>Various projects are underway to extend (freely-distributable and modifiable) Wordnet, although only those sanctioned by the Princeton team are included with the official �Wordnet� package. For example, a number of Euro Wordnet packages are available that offer a similar systematisation of a number of languages besides English, and the Extended Wordnet project aims to disambiguate and deconstruct the glosses in terms of synsets.</p>
<p>I haven�t used Wordnet for anything other than playing around, but I am impressed by it. It appears fairly comprehensive, and it seems to me that if it didn�t already exist, someone else would build it, since it provides a service that I would think many AI and NLP projects would want to build up on at some stage. At the very least, even if someone built a reasonably competent natural language system which didn�t rely on Wordnet whatsoever, Wordnet would be of some use in cementing its lexicon. Of course, it could be argued that any system in a position to use Wordnet in such a way might well be close to being able to use a normal dictionary. At this stage, I wouldn�t want to be pressed on exactly how Wordnet might be useful to AI or NLP researchers.</p>
<p>Brian mentioned that a handful of complaints are often levelled at it (namely that there are too many disconnected synsets, the glosses in their present form are useless, as well as the inevitable taxonomic disagreements), but broadly speaking, I think it manages the tricky trade-off between machine- and human-readability pretty well.</p>
<h2 id="wordnet-word-pairs">Wordnet word pairs</h2>
<h3 id="cat-dog">Cat � dog</h3>
<p>cat, true cat -- (feline mammal usually having thick soft fur and being unable to roar; domestic cats; wildcats)</p>
<p>������ =&gt; feline, felid</p>
<p>���������� =&gt; carnivore</p>
<p>dog, domestic dog, Canis familiaris -- (a member of the genus Canis (probably descended from the common wolf) that has been domesticated by man since prehistoric times; occurs in many breeds; "the dog barked all night")</p>
<p>������ =&gt; canine, canid</p>
<p>���������� =&gt; carnivore</p>
<h3 id="cool-warm">Cool � warm</h3>
<p>cool (vs. warm) -- (neither warm or very cold; giving relief from heat; "a cool autumn day"; "a cool room"; "cool summer dresses"; "cool drinks"; "a cool breeze")</p>
<p>warm (vs. cool) -- (having or producing a comfortable and agreeable degree of heat or imparting or maintaining heat; "a warm body"; "a warm room"; "a warm climate"; "a warm coat")</p>
<h3 id="cool-bad">Cool � bad</h3>
<p>cool -- ((informal) socially adept; "it's not cool to arrive at a party too early")</p>
<p>antonym: INDIRECT (VIA felicitous) -&gt; infelicitous -- (not appropriate in application; defective; "an infelicitous remark"; "infelicitous phrasing"; "the infelicitous typesetting was due to illegible copy")</p>
<p>=&gt; unfortunate (vs. fortunate) -- (not favored by fortune; marked or accompanied by or resulting in ill fortune; "an unfortunate turn of events"; "an unfortunate decision"; "unfortunate investments"; "an unfortunate night for all concerned")</p>
<p>bad (vs. good)</p>
<p>������ =&gt; atrocious, abominable, awful, dreadful, painful, terrible, unspeakable</p>
<p>������ =&gt; corked, corky -- ((of wine)</p>
<p>������ =&gt; deplorable, distressing, lamentable, pitiful, sad, sorry</p>
<p>������ =&gt; fearful, frightful, terrible</p>
<p>������ =&gt; fine, pretty</p>
<p>������ =&gt; hard, tough</p>
<p>������ =&gt; hopeless</p>
<p>������ =&gt; horrid</p>
<p>������ =&gt; icky, crappy, lousy, rotten, shitty, stinking, stinky</p>
<p>������ =&gt; incompetent, unskilled</p>
<p>������ =&gt; mediocre</p>
<p>������ =&gt; mischievous, naughty</p>
<p>������ =&gt; negative</p>
<p>������ =&gt; poor</p>
<p>������ =&gt; rubber, no-good</p>
<p>������ =&gt; severe</p>
<p>������ =&gt; swingeing</p>
<p>������ =&gt; unfavorable</p>
<p>������ =&gt; unsatisfactory</p>
<p>������ =&gt; unsuitable</p>
<p>������ =&gt; ill</p>
<p>I couldn�t find an immediate link between �cool� and its synonyms/antonyms (felicitous/infelicitous, fortunate/unfortunate) to �bad� and its antonyms (good, favorable/unfavorable, satisfactory/unsatisfactory etc.) though I�m sure there would be one within a couple more hops.</p>
<p>Also, Wordnet did not contain �bad� as used in the informal sense to mean �really good� (e.g. �that triple somersault was <em>bad</em> �) which was the sense I was originally looking for.</p>
<h3 id="hand-finger">Hand � finger</h3>
<p>hand, manus, hook, mauler, mitt, paw -- (the (prehensile) extremity of the superior limb; "he had the hands of a surgeon"; "he extended his mitt")</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: digital arteries, arteria digitalis -- (arteries in the hand and foot that supply the fingers and toes)</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: metacarpal artery, arteria metacarpea -- (dorsal and palmar arteries of the hand)</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: intercapitular vein, vena intercapitalis -- (veins connecting the dorsal and palmar veins of the hand or the dorsal and plantar veins of the foot)</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: metacarpal vein, vena metacarpus -- (dorsal and palmar veins of the hand)</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: palm -- (the inner surface of the hand from the wrist to the base of the fingers)</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: finger -- (any of the terminal members of the hand (sometimes excepting the thumb); "her fingers were long and thin")</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: ball -- (a more or less rounded anatomical body or mass; ball of the human foot or ball at the base of the thumb; "he stood on the balls of his feet")</p>
<p>��������� HAS PART: metacarpus -- (the part of the hand between the carpus and phalanges)</p>
<h3 id="scoff-eat">Scoff � eat</h3>
<p>�Scoff� is a British idiomatic verb to mean �eat fast/greedily� (e.g. �he scoffed all the cakes�). Wordnet did not list this as a sense of �scoff�.</p>
<p>1. jeer, scoff, flout, barrack, gibe -- (laugh or scoff at; "The crowd jeered at the speaker")</p>
<p>2. scoff, flout -- (treat with contemptuous disregard; "flout the rules")</p>
