<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Mr
Snowdon, Mind V</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>McGinn discusses the mind as having two components, one
passive, one active, will and perception. Functionally, our usual
perception-action loop of �Perceive the current state of the world. Act
accordingly. Then perceive the current state of the world now�� requires both
elements of mind. But if we were to sever the connection, could we imagine a
mind equipped with only one of perception or action?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Certainly in evolutionary terms an animal that can act
without a perceptive faculty would be hopelessly maladaptive � it would run
into trees, get swallowed up with ease by predators, be unable to find food
etc. But is it even conceivable? Such an animal would have no contact with its
external world, certainly. But even if it had no predators and could itself
automatically on thin air, it would be unaware of itself. It would get no
somatic feedback, so it would not know what it wanted or needed. But if it
wasn�t even aware of its own acts of will, then it seems that we cannot really
ascribe such a being with mentality at all. A mental life consisting wholly of
acts of will would have no sense of self, or time passing, or desires. I would
be reluctant to describe it as mental at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, McGinn considers that perhaps an animal
without will is conceivable, i.e. we can imagine that God could create one if
he chose. A hapless animal without will would be able to see the hungry
predator strolling towards it, might even have time for its life to flash
before its eyes, but would be helpless to fight off the predator, to run away
or even to hide. We might imagine a mushroom with eyes, living in a field of
hungry, mushroom-loving mushroom-eaters. Unlikely to evolve, and very unlikely
to survive unless something changes, but still conceivable. Galen Strawson
addresses the question with his lengthy discussion of the �Weather Watchers�,
beings with mental life but no means whatsoever of exhibiting outward
behaviour. They might desire that the weather that they watched continuously be
a certain way, but he argues that this desire does not entail a desire to <i>act</i>,
to influence the outcome. But to talk of mentality without will is an even
stronger constraint than to talk of mentality without behaviour. A mental life
without will would be robbed of the ability to direct its attention or to
initiate a train of thought. Though Strawson is persuasive in the case of his
behaviourless beings, beings with mentality but without will might be more akin
to rocks. After all, if we were to take some sort of extreme functionalist
viewpoint that sees consciousness as arising out of the process of neural
activity in some way, then why might not all of nature�s processes be conscious
to some degree. This leads to an inverse statement of the problem of other
minds � how do we know that <i>everything</i> around us isn�t conscious? We
should perhaps remind ourselves that thoughts spring into consciousness
unbidden, and that even if we can somehow subconsciously vet them or gauge their
direction, we are in effect observers to our own thought processes. Crucially
though, we can certainly direct our attention with relative freedom and we can
end or attempt to consider separate trains of thought, and so we won�t digress
any further about the wholly different case of a mentality with no will
whatsoever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In both cases, conation without cognition or vice versa, we
find that we can conceive of the one aspect dominating the other, but the idea
of being equipped for one entirely without the other is inconceivable. So we
can state a conceptual, as well as an evolutionary imperative for their
intimate relatedness. As McGinn concludes, to emphasise one at the expense of
the other misses their inseparability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He moves on to discuss actions, starting with the basic
action of raising one�s hand, and contrasts it with an identical-seeming
movement resulting from, say, a muscle spasm. We would want to regard the two
as different, differentiable by how active or passive the �agent� was in
initiating the action. When I raise my hand, I consciously choose to, there is <i>volition</i>.
When my hand is flung upwards by a gust of wind, this aim for the action to
occur just before it does, is lacking. But to simply label the distinction,
�volition�, does not really help us. Indeed, it is important that we don�t just
regard human movements as actions � animals and babies are capable of actions.
An animal that leaps over a river is performing an action, whereas an animal
whose body is catapulted into the air by an impact is not. There need not be a
rational, expressible reason for an action, though often we can make sense of
it in rational terms. Indeed, here we are coming closer to pinning down
actions: they are bodily events which originate in the agent which can be accorded
a purpose. I raise my arm to get the blood flowing or to wave to a friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem with defining action in purely teleological
terms is that we can see a purpose in my stomach�s digestion and my heart�s
beating. Yet we would like to exclude them from willed movements because they
are involuntary, i.e. they still lack this mysterious �volition�. It is
obviously enough to simply talk of observable events, because my reflex of
withdrawing my hand from a hot object is a bodily event that has a purpose (not
burning my hand) and is observable � but though the gross movement was
generated from a multitude of motor signals originating in my brain, it did not
somehow satisfy the requirement of �[originating] in the agent�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are seeking a means of restricting willed actions more
narrowly than simply purposive behaviour and less narrowly than rational, human
intent. We can use the criteria of �trying� � whether we can non-metaphorically
say of the agent in question that it is <i>trying</i> to do something without being
guilty of over-anthromorphising it in some way. Neither worms nor thermostats
are trying to achieve the purposes we ascribe them, though it is convenient and
predictive to take what Dennett terms the �intentional stance� in pretending
that they do. We can identify �actions� by being able to describe an agent as
�trying� to do something. This is narrower than simply being able to see their
behaviour in teleological terms, and wider than claiming they are being guided
by full-blown rationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This highlights two halves to an �action� � the willing and
the movement, i.e. the mental and the physical acts. Every action has this
inherent psychophysical duality. Yet when I psychologically try to move my arm
(i.e. aim to produce that movement in the way that I do every day as a direct
precursor to that movement actually happening), but find that nothing happens,
I have still <i>tried</i>. How then is the trying related to the action? There
are four theories, all taking the definition of action as a �willed movement�:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>The action <i>is</i> the movement. But in order for the
movement to have been counted as an action, �trying� had to have been one of
its antecedents. The action and movement are identical, and the trying was not
part of the movement, so it cannot be said to be part of the action. But, it is
a requirement that for a movement to be <i>considered</i> an action, it must be
preceded by trying. Thus, movements and actions are intrinsically the same, but
distinguished by their relations to an extrinsic object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>This time, an action is identical with the trying. In this
case then, the resulting bodily event is a contingent extrinsic matter. The
trying and the action are one and the same, but a trying becomes an action by
virtue of its consequences (i.e. a corresponding bodily movement).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both these theories can be dismissed as regarding either the
trying or the movement as being contingent and extrinsic, but actions need to
be more closely related to both the psychological and bodily aspects. �An
action is no more the cause of a movement than it is the effect of a trying�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>Action is successful trying. Thus, both trying and movement
are constitutive of the action. This way of thinking about actions encompasses
the whole psychophysical process, from the psychological, inner mental event of
trying to raise my arm, all the way through to the interface with the physical
which results in my arm actually rising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although this seems to be along the right lines, thinking
about actions as successful tryings results in tryings as contingently successful
and actions as necessarily successful. So actions necessarily have an outer
aspect whereas tryings do not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;

</span><![endif]>The action is composed of both trying and movement, related
causally. The action is a complex event with these two constituents. Thus the action
is related to the trying and the movement, but constitutively and not causally.
This does require a dualist ontology of mind and body as a means of unifying
the first and third person aspects of action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can try and examine more closely what is meant by
�trying�. Is it a sensation or a propositional attitude? Unlike sensations, it
is active, and it doesn�t have a phenomenological feel (it doesn�t really feel
like anything to try). Yet, like sensations, trying is necessarily conscious
and also pre-rational. Moreover, trying is not a propositional attitude (I try <i>to</i>,
not <i>that</i>, I raise my arm). Hence, trying cannot be categorised within
either of the cognitive classes, and has to be ascribed a nature of its own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like perception, trying is directed on something beyond
itself. In the case of trying, its object is the body, or at least the parts
where we have motor control. However, it cannot be said that I try to move my
arm, so much that my trying is directed towards a pointer which refers to my
arm. But could we perform willed movements without this acquaintance with our
body which seems to derive from our proprioceptive and kinaesthetic
perceptions? If we were deprived of our (internal perceptual) awareness of our
body, then would we able to direct our trying towards it still? If the answer
is �no�, then a creature with will but lacking the perception to form this
proprioceptive awareness would be unable to <i>act</i>, to move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains to investigate the antecedents of action.
Minimally, these include some feeling of need and some sort of belief state
which connects an action with fulfilling that need. For rational creatures, the
antecedents of action are desire, belief and intention. The desire provides the
motivation for the action, the belief state is that a causal relation holds
between the motivation and the action, and the intention provides the resolve
to proceed. None of these three antecedents can be reduced or expressed in
terms of the other two, though desire and belief combined make up a �reason�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Davidsonian terms, for an event to be an action, the
event must be describable in a specific way, i.e. an event that an agent
performs with intentions and for reasons. The same action may be intentional
under one description and not under another. For an action to be an event, we
must be able to conceive of at least one description under which it is
intentional. Davidson claims that reason explanation is a form of causal
explanation. <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>In this way, reasons are
the causes of the actions they are reason for.</span> The solution to the
conflict depends on the distinction between events and their descriptions. The
explanation of an agent�s action can only be considered adequate if it shows
the action in question to be reasonable (i.e. consistent with) the background of
the agent's beliefs and motivations. This conditioned, combined with the idea
that propositional and rational attitudes attributed to an agent must be true
(the truth condition) form the necessary conditions for the <i>justification
model</i> of explanation. The explanation of action by reference to reasons is
also a form of causal explanation, i.e. when we refer to an agent�s intentions
or motives in acting, we are attempting to offer a causal explanation of that
action. Explanation by reference to reasons was seen to be distinct from
explanation by reference to causes as rational explanation was held not to
involve reference to laws, but instead required showing how the action fitted
into some larger pattern of rational behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Significant in Davidson�s account is the notion of a
�primary reason�, comprised of the belief relating to the action and the
desire. A second important idea is that of action �under a description�. This
simply means that one single action can always be explained in terms of more
than one correct description. This is important as it provides an explanation
of how the same action (item of behaviour) can be understood as being
intentional under some descriptions and not under others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we understand the connection between reason and action as
rational, then it cannot be described in terms of a strict law. However, in
understanding such a connection to be causal in nature, we are assuming the
existence of some law-like regularity. Such a law-like connection would not by
classical definitions of causality also be rational. Davidson claims that such
a nomological connection would not be describable in the language of
rationality and can therefore be causal even though it does not specify any
strict law. He maintains therefore that rational explanation need not involve
explicit reference to any law-like regularity, while nevertheless also
maintaining some such regularity must exist due to the fact that there is an
underlying causal property to the rational connection. Moreover, since Davidson
resists the idea that rational explanations can be formulated in terms of a
predictive science, so he seems committed to denying that there can be any
reduction of rational to non-rational explanation.</p>
