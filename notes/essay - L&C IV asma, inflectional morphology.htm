<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The English past tense provides plenty of interesting
evidence for linguists trying to learn about how we learn and use language. To
form the imperfect tense of a regular verb, we tend to simply add �-ed� to the
end of a verb, so for example, �lift� becomes �lifted�. In the case of
irregular verbs, a variety of changes are possible. Sometimes groups of
irregular verbs follow patterns, such as �bring/brought� and �think/thought�,
often involving vowel changes, e.g. �smite/smote/smitten�,
�strive/strove/striven�, �take/took/taken�. In a few exceptional cases, two
verbs have merged � so now �go� goes to �go�, but in the past tense, it borrows
from how �wend� went to �went�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Inflectional morphology� is the study of such changes.
Morphology is the area of grammar related to morphemes, the most basic units of
meaning in language. A morpheme can be a word root, such as �cran� in
�cranberry�, or entire words like �bird�, �cup� or �take�. To this stem, we can
add the affixes: prefixes, suffixes and infixes, so called according to where
they are added to the stem (English contains no infixes, which are slotted inside
the stem, though Swahili does). Thus a word is composed of one or more
morphemes joined together. For instance, the word �unremovable� can be broken
up into its stem, �remove�, the smallest unit of meaning (any smaller and you
get syllables, then phonemes), then add the suffix �able� to get �removable�,
then the prefix �un�. Morphemes can be either derivational or inflectional.
Inflectional morphemes change the grammatical status of the word, such as the
suffix �-ed� which indicates the past tense, whereas derivational morphemes,
such as �un-�, change the meaning of the word. We are concerned largely with
inflectional morphemes, though our use of derivational morphology displays many
of the same properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>The regular/irregular
distinction of past tense forms of verbs is particularly visible in infant
language acquisition studies. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Marcus et
al�s</i> studies on over-regularisation (applying regularisation rules such as
�run-ran� in the past tense to �bring� to get �brung�) indicate a conflict in
the sequence of their semantic and syntactic developments, as they initially
learn the correct form, then learn the regularisation rule and then apply it
too widely. It appears that infants learn the irregular verbs quite early
(probably because the irregular verbs tend to be amongst the most common, which
is itself an interesting observation, as we will see below). Then, they start
to learn the regular verb patterns, and are able to generate the past tense of
verbs for themselves (it seems most unlikely that an infant would have heard
the past <i>and</i> present tense of every verb they use). Interestingly, they
appear to <i>over-regularise</i>, and start to employ these regular verb rules
to the irregular verbs they had learnt by rote already, for example, �I broked�
or �I holded�. Then, in a u-shaped profile of learning, they have to relearn
these irregular forms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>There are various accounts of
how this might work. Early models focused too heavily on one aspect of a
child�s learning, either by arguing that we learn each new verb individually or
that we have a large number of complex rules. However, it seems much more
sensible now to see this in terms of a rule which can be applied by default,
but is inhibited in the case of irregular verbs to allow for the rote-learned
exceptional form to be used. We will leave the debate about rules and the
symbolic approach as opposed to connectionism aside for now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;mso-pagination:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>Pinker uses nonsense words to
illustrate our putatively innate ability to create novel words by following the
generation patterns, or �rules�, inherent in the inflectional morphology of a
given language. His experiment centred around the invented word, �wug�, and the
plural that almost all English speakers assumed it to have, �wugs�. Here it is
important that he chose a phonetically legitimate word in English, otherwise it
would seem foreign and we might not make the same assumptions about it that we
do about English words we have not heard. He takes as an example of innate
linguistic mechanisms this ability to learn the rules tacitly operating in
language, such as adding �ed� to the past tenses of irregular verbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;mso-pagination:none'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>A further interesting avenue of
research focuses around word frequency, measurable in terms of the number of
occurrences in a corpus of a certain size<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
The Brown Corpus contains one million words, taken from a range of sources and
intended to be representative of the various uses of the English language in
both speech and writing. The number of occurrences of a given word (which may
or may not include its various forms and senses, depending on the purpose of
the experiment) in the corpus can be taken as an indication of its rarity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>The most revealing studies tend
to focus on the most common and the fairly rare. For example, of the ten most
common verbs in English (e.g. �be�, �go�, �do�, �make�), almost all share one
thing in common � they are irregular. Conversely, of the 877 rare verbs which
occur only once in the Brown Corpus (though there will be many extremely rare
verbs which may not occur in even a million words of text), all but one
(�smite�) are regular. This is clearly no coincidence. Pinker argues
convincingly that irregular verbs need to be learnt by rote, and so we need to
hear them at least once, if not more often. Rare verbs may only crop up once or
twice in our early years and maybe not at all in the past tense. As a result,
rare irregular verbs do not last long. New generations of speakers who rarely
hear the word �slay�, and hear �slew� more rarely still, will find �slayed�
quite natural<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>. This is the
process by which language evolves, and over time, words lose their irregular
forms, just as we have lost �chid� and �dempt� from Middle English, but gained
�sneak/snuck� and �catch/caught�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>We can understand why almost all
of the rarer verbs are regular because their irregular forms have been
forgotten. Indeed, when subjects are faced with an elicited-production
experiment where they are asked to finish the statement �I agglutinate, but
yesterday I ___�, they almost always opt for �agglutinated�, despite almost
never coming into contact with the word. The explanation of why all our most
common verbs are <i>so</i> irregular is less clear � certainly their irregular
forms would have survived, but it does not seem so clear why the common verbs
should have <i>become</i> so irregular. Unless however, we see this creation of
new verb forms as the same process that allows children to learn regularisation
rules in the first place. In Arkansas, like so many other dialects, different
rules apply from the arbitrary standard known as Standard English: �help/holp�,
�slid/slood�, and elsewhere �took/tooken�, are examples of this creative
regularisation gone wrong. Importantly though, we are not simply adding �-ed�
here, but rather regularising into families of irregular verbs (just as infants
over-regularise from �ring/rung� to �bring/brung�).</p>

<p>Late learners of English may fail to recognise sentences such as <i>&quot;Yesterday
the girl pet a dog.&quot;</i> are grammatically incorrect, since these
inflections require us to master quite long-range dependencies that contain
redundant information. Language utilises redundance to make up for imperfect

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none'>The dual-route hypothesis points
to the transition from rote-learning to symbolic rule-governed behaviour as the
source of the over-regularisation error. Having learned the rule, they then
have to re-learn the irregular verbs so that they �block� access to the
rule-based route. Strengthening the representational strength of this blocking
of irregular verbs results from increased exposure, which is why infrequent
irregular forms get over-regularised most. The irregular forms would be
consolidated in an associative network that runs in parallel with the
rule-based network for representing regular verb forms. Double dissociations in
language disorders where children preserve performance on regular verbs but not
irregular, and vice versa, lends credence to this dual-route idea.</p>

<p>Connectionist models have been employed to try and demonstrate such effects
without explicitly coding for a system of regular rules and irregular
exceptions. One influential early connectionist model was a net trained by
Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) to predict the past tense of English verbs. </p>

<p>The net was first trained on a set containing a large number of irregular
verbs, and later on a set of 460 verbs containing mostly regulars. The net
learned the past tenses of the 460 verbs in about 200 rounds of training, and
it generalized fairly well to verbs not in the training set. It even showed a
good appreciation of &quot;regularities&quot; to be found among the irregular
verbs (send / sent, build / built; blow / blew, fly / flew). During learning,
as the system was exposed to the training set containing more regular verbs, it
had a promisingly infant-like tendency to overregularize (e.g. break / broked,
instead of break / broke), correctable with more training.</p>

<p>However, the model is poor at generalising to some novel regular verbs,
which Pinker &amp; Prince (1988) point to as a failing of connectionist models
in general. They believe that neural nets are good at making associations and
matching patterns but they have fundamental limitations in mastering such
general rules as the formation of the regular past tense. Connectionist
modellers have defended themselves against the wider criticism that neural nets
are ill-suited to the generalising necessary to master cognitive tasks
involving rules (e.g. Niklasson and van Gelder, 1994).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems clear that our use and misuse of English regular
and irregular past tense forms of verbs demonstrates an ability to generalise
rules and regularities, and to generate forms of previously unheard past tenses
when necessary. Indeed, this �creativeness� causes infants to over-generalise
when learning new verbs, and even to confuse which verbs are regular, and verbs
which are irregular so should not be generalised. Connectionist models need to
be able to account for these experimental results, which suggest a dual-route
system of rules with a list of exceptions � yet a connectionist model has to
represent declarative rules and rote-learned lists in a distributed,
non-symbolic way. Yet early models have learned to differentiate regular and
irregular verbs within a restricted training domain, and more encouragingly
still, have produced over-generalisation in a human child-like way.</p>

to people experimentally to verify this. People were unsure whether faced with
the correct or incorrect form of an irregular verb, since the regular form
might not seem quite right, yet the irregular form might sound strange too.</p>
