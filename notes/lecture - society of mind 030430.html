<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 30, 2003</p>
<p>why do people like music? why�s it such a big industry?</p>
<p>sleep</p>
<p>Stickold study � people who sleep less than 8 hours get a lot done but they don�t remember it</p>
<p>Hobson � might not initially have had any function � started in vertebrates around fish-time � if you could suspend animation for half the time, then you�d minimise half the accidents (the ones you�re less used/adapted to)</p>
<p>Shakespeare � �knits up the raveled sleeve of care�</p>
<p>allows you to reconcile and integrate your new experiences without interference from external experience � REM for untangling mis-structures that have got cross-linked in bad ways � stimulate one then the other, and if there�s too much crossover you clean one of them up</p>
<p>perhaps that�s why dolphins don�t need to sleep with both half-brains at once � because their environment doesn�t have day/night-times</p>
<p>Minsky: well, they�d drown otherwise. same with seagulls and albatrosses</p>
<p>would a dolphin have two personalities?</p>
<p>sleep�s a suitcase mechanism � once you�ve got something like it, a dozen reasons grow up to take advantage of it</p>
<p>that�s why he doesn�t like Descartes� Error � he uses ordinary words as though they mean something � whereas the neurology people should expect to have to find new concepts for what the brain is doing � in other sciences, they don�t use ordinary words very much</p>
<p>stickold � got people to practice tetris, and to daydream about it � they reported they dreamed about it � then next day, they had improved, and continued to improve for three more days</p>
<p>difference between goals and objectives (as used in business or school)</p>
<p>goals are abstract, objectives are things you need to do to get the goals</p>
<p>objectives are sub-goals</p>
<p>but sometimes goals are concrete, but objectives are abstract</p>
<p>this is dumb � because goal structures are hierarchical � they don�t have a word for sub-sub-goal</p>
<p>perhaps you restrict it to two levels because it forces you then to delegate on your objectives to your subordinate</p>
<p>apparently lucid dreaming is actually teachable</p>
<p>do you still improve at tetris if you lucid dream? can you direct your learning?</p>
<p>Jose: is it true that the left hemisphere isn�t active during dreaming?</p>
<p>he reckons that when you dream, you rearrange the sequence/events afterwards</p>
<p>Steve: you could play people a bunch of noises that don�t wake them up, and then ask them about the narrative sequence afterwards</p>
<p>Hally + Eden (sp???) � played people two headphones, one saying a sentence, the other with a click, and people reported afterwards that the click occurred on a phrase boundary</p>
<p>perhaps this is because different parts of the brain are processing speech sounds, and when this gets summarised at the high level�</p>
<p>I often wonder whether minsky�s theories, based on experiences with his children, must be heavily skewed, given that his kids must be prodigiously bright and kind of funny</p>
<p>refce Hollander � poems �Rhymes reason�</p>
<p>he tries to make some of the bits he wants to convince people of more metered</p>
<p>the whole of the first few pages of Emotion Machine are in meter</p>
<p>some writers give different characters different meters</p>
<p>refce Sturgeon � did this without realising, until his creative writing students pointed it out</p>
<p>some writers have a backstory, i.e. they know 10 times more than the readers about the novel</p>
<p>Huxley�s characters always seem stereotyped and predictable, perhaps because he only uses 3 or 4 features � Tolstoy�s always seem unpredictable, perhaps because they have 7 or 8</p>
<p>why is visualisation more vivid than dreaming?</p>
<p>no external experience to distract</p>
<p>the smarter you are, the smarter your neighbours are � evolutionary arms race</p>
<p>refce: current Nature, reviewing the differences between humans, apes etc.</p>
<p>there may only be 30,000 genes, but there are more than 100,000 differences between us and the chimp</p>
<p>a gene is a big thing</p>
<p>chimpanzees have the same size skull, but it�s much much thicker</p>
<p>maybe constrained by the need for birth</p>
<p>Bell Labs � worked on projects that would come to fruition in 40 years� time</p>
<p>oil as a curse for a country :) � you get corrupt governments, and the oil industry pays more than any other and dominates the entire country�s economy</p>
<p>1960s: �while you�re up, get me a grant�</p>
<p>Congress put constraints on the max length in years of a grant</p>
<p>declining proportion of faculty to assistants � allowed the professors to handle a relatively greater teaching load</p>
<p>he thinks it�s getting pretty good now, because he can see most of the bugs in his ideas in his friends</p>
<p>I said that common sense reasoning�s time has not yet come � you need to get the architecture right first</p>
<p>Push: that I�m confusing the common sense architecture and knowledge problems</p>
<p>noone could have written the 12 dimensions of context space except someone who had tried to build an encyclopaedic system</p>
<p>parasites don�t damage tissue</p>
<p>me: NSA fund brain-eating worms that you could attach a thread to :)</p>
<p>Nancy: thinks it�s wrong to use the data from the Siberia experiments on people</p>
<p>me: it would make their sacrifices meaningless</p>
<p>reality tv with accompanying brain data � put it on the web and hackers can try and decode it :)</p>
<p>me: suicide�s a cry for attention � they should have a clinic for people to volunteer to be zapped � after all, what could get more attention than having your name in the most-cited paper of the year? :)</p>
<p>psychologist prof: Purdue class � better to read the Turing Option before the SoM</p>
<p>storing OMCS assertions as NL allows you to choose your level of precision/ambiguity afterwards</p>
