<p>Greg Detre</p>
<p>Wednesday, April 02, 2003</p>
<p>wants to get rid of hand-shaking �source of 30% of all infectious diseases!</p>
<p>apparently Japanese have longer life-span</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>Hugo: evolutionary advantage of genes to age?</p>
<p>variation???</p>
<p>bacteria don�t get old and die</p>
<p>sharks don�t age either</p>
<p>may be an urban myth � but they don�t seem to get cancer</p>
<p>thurber, �why should salt suffer?� � vegetarian friend decided not to eat vegetables, leaving just salt in his diet J</p>
<p>a big part of common sense knowledge is heuristics about different types of processes to use for different types of problem</p>
<p>Push: �common sense� vs �commonsense� � the second is a technical/specialist modifier</p>
<p>Steve: problem solving vs common sense?</p>
<p>common sense is often what you need as the ingredients for solving a problem � problem-solving as goal-satisfaction</p>
<p>if you�re going to have a theory of memory, maybe you need a theory of forgetting</p>
<p>refce: introduction to Roget�s thesaurus</p>
<p>considers that Papert�s different ideas in French may be a result of being imprimed by Piaget</p>
<p>piaget rod task � children took a long time to learn that colour could represent different materials of different strengths</p>
<p>one of the important ways of thinking has to do with how your top-down and your bottom-up influence each other</p>
<p>seven league springy boots allow you to go really fast, but the slightest mis-step would send you hurling into a passing car J</p>
<p>C S Peirce in the 1850s � taxonomy of 4 ways of fixing beliefs � refce �The fixation of beliefs�</p>
<p>tenacity � I�m determining to hold onto this belief</p>
<p>authority � a holy figure told me to believe this</p>
<p>aesthetics � choose to believe things because it suits their sense of appropriateness</p>
<p>science � his preference</p>
<p>Frank Thomas � Disney cartoonist behind 3/7 dwarfs</p>
<p>people seem to prefer straight lines to parabolas of cartoon thrown objects, so long as you show the throwing motion and cut to the catching figure � that sounds implausible</p>
<p>McLeod � the physics of comics � the more real, you attribute the wrong things to it � you�re better off leaving things symbolic</p>
<p>children may use concrete language, but they seem to draw abstract symbols</p>
<p>e.g. 3 year-old told to draw a square and a diamond, drew a bumpy circle then a blob with points at the top and bottom � can�t draw shapes till 6 or 7</p>
<p>common sense community</p>
<p>forbus! � northwestern � using equations etc. to model common sense physics</p>
<p>ben kuijpers - texas</p>
<p>attacks cognitive science</p>
<p>says they don�t simulate</p>
<p>lack interesting function-concepts</p>
<p>still basing their models on old AI ideas</p>
<p>their plan is to have 3 different ideas for doing everything � neural nets can never do that</p>
<p>I don�t understand why he�s anti self-organisation</p>
<p>seems to have implied that kids don�t do that much self-organisation</p>
<p>because it�s hard/rare in nature</p>
<p>hmmm</p>
<p>refce: Steve Larson: Fuster � Omega model � old � �Memory and cerebral cortex�</p>
