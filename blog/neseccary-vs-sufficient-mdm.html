        <p>Philosophers and mathematicians make a distinction between ‘necessary’ and ‘sufficient’.</p>
<p>Air is <em>necessary</em> for human life, but it’s not <em>sufficient</em>. In other words, if you don’t have air then it’s game over. But if you do have air, you still need some other stuff to survive. So it’s not <em>sufficient</em> for survival.</p>
<p>If you’re a father, you’re definitely male. So being a father is a <em>sufficient</em> condition for being a male. (But you could be a male without being a father, so it’s not <em>necessary</em>.)</p>
<p>By the way, my favourite data science-related example of something being <em>sufficient but not necessary</em> is the Turing Test. If you pass the Turing Test, you’re definitely intelligent. So it’s sufficient. [Hah, reading this a few years later, this sentence has not aged well!]</p>
<p>But you <em>could</em> fail it, and <em>still</em> be intelligent. Perhaps you’re French, and don’t speak English. Or more interestingly, maybe you’re an alien with a different way of thinking. So it’s <em>not</em> necessary.</p>
<p>So passing the Turing Test is a <em>sufficient</em> but not <em>necessary</em> test of intelligence.</p>
