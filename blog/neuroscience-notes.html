<h1>Neuroscience notes (OBSOLETE)</h1>




<p><em>[I've taken these down, because they weren't good enough, and there are so many better resources now.]</em></p>
<p>The neuroscience notes for my PhD qualifying exam are now online as <a href="/notes/neuro_generals/">browsable individual webpages</a> (originally written with <a href="http://www.mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html">Emacs Muse</a>).</p>
<p>The notes are in wiki form - in other words, I tried to give every brain region, tract, disorder, function and topic its own page. Emacs Muse automatically created the hyperlinks as I was typing (thanks to <a href="https://psychology.as.virginia.edu/people/sederberg">Per Sederberg</a>'s implicit linking patch. In reality, many of the pages are missing or sparse, since this is a pretty gargantuan task. There's also the possibility that things are inaccurate. For instance, I'm pretty sure there's some confusion regarding the nucleus reticularis vs nucleus reticularis pontis oralis, since I didn't initially realize that they're distinct brain regions with similar names...  </p>
<p>Anyway, you're welcome to use, modify and distribute these in any way you'd like, though I'd appreciate a shout-out if you do. Consider them to be released with a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license</a>, though I've been lazy and not included the license file. I'd doubly appreciate hearing about any flaws or confusions you find. I'm still working on these, and so I may one day release an updated version.  </p>
<p>Obviously, to some degree this is reinventing the wheel. Most of these notes are from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Neural-Science-Eric-Kandel/dp/0838577016">Kandel &amp; Schwarz</a> (4th edition), and you can find most of this stuff online, e.g. the wikipedia has some good pages on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">brain</a>, though the usual caveats apply. I also learned a lot about the pros and cons of wikifying knowledge along the way, but that's the topic of another post.</p>
