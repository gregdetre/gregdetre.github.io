<h1><span class="starred-badge" aria-label="Starred" title="Starred post">★</span>The real reason we can’t define 'Artificial General Intelligence'</h1>






<p>Could it be that the real reason we struggle to define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is that <strong>any clean, broad definition of general intelligence would exclude <em>us</em></strong>?</p>
<p>Intelligence is hard to pin down, but I like these two related definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flexible, goal-directed behaviour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient skill acquisition (from Francois Chollet)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to reformulate these as: <em>learning how to do something without much to go on, and then applying it in new ways</em>.</p>
<p>How do we measure up against this?</p>
<p>Yes, we can certainly acquire new skills that we didn't evolve for. We are comparatively flexible. The AIs that <em>are</em> super-human, like AlphaZero, tend to be pretty narrow in applicability.) And yes, our learning is comparatively sample-efficient. (For every book that a human child has read, GPT-4 has read 10,000.) We can occasionally generalise out of distribution in ingenious ways.</p>
<p>But. We struggle to transfer knowledge outside the learned context. We make mistakes even when we know better or in principle. We struggle to learn new concepts, languages, skills, habits - we struggle to change our ways, even when we want to. We behave sub-optimally, both wittingly and unwittingly, even when it's pointed out. In short, we struggle to learn how to do some things, and then we struggle to apply them.</p>
<p>So, our intelligence is more general than the best AIs in 2024, by a good distance. But 'general intelligence' is a continuum rather than binary, and our intelligence is only somewhat general.</p>
<p>In practice, the only clean definition in AI is for superintelligence - "better than the best of us at everything". And I think that's probably still a way off.</p>
