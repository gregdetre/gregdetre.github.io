      <h2>Google, here's some context</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>So often, when I'm searching on Google, I want to give it some context. For instance, I'm looking for pages about Django (the Python-based web framework). They'll probably mention 'python', 'web', 'database' and 'programming'. I could feed in this query:  </p>
<p>Django python web database programming  </p>
<p>But I'd actually get a very restricted set of results back - just those that include *all* of those terms (give or take some Googley cleverness).  </p>
<p>So I could instead do this:  </p>
<p>Django python OR web OR database OR programming  </p>
<p>This would certainly be progress. As long as the page mentioned one of those terms, I'd be golden. But there are two issues with this:  </p>
<ol>
<li>I want to be able to stipulate that it doesn't need to mention those exact terms, but rather stuff related to them.</li>
<li>I don't think the page would get bonus points for mentioning more than one of those terms, as it should</li>
</ol>
<p>It's frustrating that I can't type something like:  </p>
<p>Django context:(python web database programming)  </p>
<p><a href="http://labs.google.com/sets">Google Sets</a>Â (or something sophisticated akin) should be able to fill in the rest.</p>
