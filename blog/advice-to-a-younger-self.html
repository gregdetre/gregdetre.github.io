Really visualise it. What advice would you give your younger self? Is it consistent? Honestly doing the exercise is far more interesting than reading other people’s answers."</h3>
<p><em>(<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/914189738453622784">from Naval Ravikant</a>)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drink more water when you go out boozing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procrastination is an unwillingness to sit with your own discomfort, and willpower is a mood/energy state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your environment and home situation both affect how well you recharge. Invest in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve your posture and tense your core to stay awake when sleepy in a lecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You feel way better and more energised when you exercise more and feel part of a community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn as much maths and technical stuff as you can when you’re young. Don’t just read textbooks and audit the classes - you only learn if you do the exercises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not invincible. You need balance in your life to be able to continue to work well and stay happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch the channel on your inner monologue when it’s not serving you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regular meditation gives you just a little more chance to notice your inner monologue, and to choose what you say and how you respond in the moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s better to be happy and effective than right. You'll never change someone's mind if they're feeling angry or threatened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice saying the hard things earlier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
