      <h2>File-sharing</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>file-sharing is stealing, plain and simple, authenticised, masked, justified and guilt-free, authenticised by its seeming anonymity, the fact that genuinely millions of people are doing, the bullshit myth that the recording companies are somehow evil, the refusal to consider that the industry cannot survive if no one pays for music, spurious arguments about borrowing your neighbour's tools, and because it has a nice windows interface  </p>
<p>Plato was clearly wrong when he said that no man would willingly do evil</p>
