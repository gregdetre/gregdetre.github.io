<h1>What is wisdom?</h1>






<p>Wisdom is often about truths whose opposite are truths.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about learning from one's mistakes - without beating oneself up.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about loving yourself, forgiving yourself, accepting yourself - but being honest with yourself, listening to criticism, and looking to grow.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about expecting and holding other people accountable - but also making them feel safe and forgiving them and giving them a second chance.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about preserving our traditions and institutions - without being hide-bound and closed.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about taking advantage of technology - without letting it control you.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about appreciating what we have - without needing it to be happy. About <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229592625215893504/">wanting the gold medal - without being defined by it</a>.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about taking care of those around you and yourself - but also being carefree.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about knowing and respecting one's own needs - but also the needs of others.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about being considerate of others' needs - without endlessly self-monitoring.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about being a good partner - without becoming codependent.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about knowing how to balance taking care of the person in front of you - with a million lives on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about loving yourself, and being enough - but also being dependable and loving and part of a community.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about excitement, receptiveness, and spontaneity - but also being dependable and thinking about consequences.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about zooming out, but still staying at the level of the human. Because what matters most in a human life is hard to see in atoms or galaxies.</p>
<p>Wisdom is about treating this life as precious - but also being ready to die without rancour at any moment.</p>
