    <p>religion is a decision of the viscera - if my body can be happy as an atheist i will continue to be so. if it needs more, i will follow it into christianity. i am content now. my belief system feels noble, rational, and supports me contentedly through my daily existence. they say that in war, there are no atheists. if the vagaries of this world bludgeon my resistance sufficiently, i expect i will yield to faith, what amounts to an ardent hope in God, so needy and so pure, that i can will him into psychological existence, and he in turn will answer my prayers.</p>
