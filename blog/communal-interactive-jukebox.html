<h1>Communal interactive jukebox</h1>




<p>[I wrote this in 2003 - there are still pieces of this vision that haven't been realized]  </p>
<p>why isn't there a little wireless didgeridoo that just sits next to a cd player (stereo audio input), with a wireless network card, and maybe an ip address or a network id or something that you can initially configure easily/remotely by plugging in a computer via a usb or something, that just sits there and plays whatever your laptop running winamp tells it to by wireless???  </p>
<p>apparently these exist already :(  </p>
<p>but they're pretty crap at the moment - they're proprietary, and are only just getting up to speed with 802.11b etc.  </p>
<p>this doesn't exist though:  </p>
<p>you could set a password to it, and then anyone with a laptop nearby who knew its id and had the password, could wrest control of it, e.g. at a party. better still, you could have a sort of queuing system/software for allowing different users to place requests, and people could vote whether they like what's playing and that person's reputation would go up - like slashdot karma - it would be a sort of communal interactive jukebox</p>
