<h1>What's blowin' in the wind?</h1>






<p>[Thanks to Stephen Hartley-Brewer for the kernel of this idea]  </p>
<p><a href="http://bluehoneybear.blogspot.com/">My brother is my musical weather vane</a>, my song-canary who knows what's good long before the rest of the world has cottoned on, and points out the things I'll like. I treasure his advice, partly because it's good, and partly because it comes from him.  </p>
<p>But just for badness, pretend you don't have a brother with his ear to the ground. Instead, you have a big computer that you've fed the listening habits of the entire world. Ask it two questions:  </p>
<p>1) who is listening to music that's hugely popular (or that I like) a year ago?  </p>
<p><em>Those are your early adopters.</em> </p>
<p>2) what are they listening to now?  </p>
<p>Throw in some <a href="http://gregdetre.blogspot.com/2007/04/collaborative-filtering-and-how-its.html">collaborative filtering</a> to tailor the recommendations for me.  </p>
<p>Are iTunes or Last.fm doing this to predict who's going to be big next year?  </p>
<p>Are the record labels doing this to predict where they should put their marketing money?  </p>
<p>Can bands buy this information to figure out which users to send promo albums to?  </p>
<p>If there was a prediction market for music, could my brother get paid to tell people what he likes and dislikes?</p>
