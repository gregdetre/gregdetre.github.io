<h1>Brain orchestras and fMRI analyses</h1>


<p>[With help from David Weiss]  </p>
<p>I spent much of my PhD working on algorithms for making sense of gigabytes of brain data from fMRI scanners, especially on a fairly new approach called Multi-variate Pattern Analysis (MVPA). I want to show you how the MVPA approach is useful for tackling certain kinds of questions.  </p>
<p>Think of the brain as a kind of orchestra. You have lots of separate instruments playing at the same time, and you can subdivide them in lots of different ways, e.g.  </p>
<ul>
<li>You can subdivide the orchestra into parts by location - the 1st violins, the brass, the percussion etc.</li>
<li>Or you could organize them by what they're doing. Say the 2nd violins, the oboes and the trumpets have the melody, while the clarinets and the tubas have the harmony. [The harps are doing their own thing and the bassoonist is drunk.]</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, there are all kinds of things going on at once in the brain.  </p>
<ul>
<li>You can subdivide the brain by location - frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital lobes.</li>
<li>Or you could organize the sub-parts by what they're doing - vision, language, executive control, motor etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's go back to thinking about how the multivariate approach differs in the kinds of questions it can address.  </p>
<p>Standard univariate analysis is useful if you want to tell which instruments are involved in one case rather than another, e.g.  </p>
<ul>
<li>violins are more active in Beethoven than Mozart, but for trumpets it's the other way around</li>
</ul>
<p>vs  </p>
<ul>
<li>one part of the brain is more active when looking at houses than faces, but for another part it's the other way around</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, a multivariate analysis might be useful if you want to know:  </p>
<ul>
<li>is this Mozart or Beethoven?</li>
<li>is this the brain of someone looking at faces or houses?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let's introduce one more concept: <em>dimensionality reduction</em> is an attempt to boil down many instruments (or brain regions) into a few key themes/groups:  </p>
<p>Take the famous da-da-da-dum of Beethoven's Fifth, where the entire orchestra is one voice - one could more or less describe the entire orchestra's activity in terms of just <em>one</em> theme/process. In contrast, for Bach or something more complex and interwoven, it might be very hard to summarize what's going in with less than <em>10</em> themes.  </p>
<p>Likewise, maybe it's straightforward to summarize the brain's activity with just one or two processes when you're doing a very simple task like looking at faces vs houses, but if you're doing something more complicated (like watching a movie) then multiple processes are interacting in complex ways.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.djweiss.info/cv.html">David Weiss</a>'s PACA algorithm boils down the brain's activity over time into just a few themes. Once you've summarized the 50,000 readouts we get from fMRI every few seconds into 50, it's much more feasible to try and compare different cognitive processes - just as it's much easier to compare Mozart and Beethoven by looking at the scores of a few key instruments than looking at the full orchestral scores.  </p>
<p>PACA was inspired by a bunch of existing dimensionality reduction algorithms that could equally be applied to problems like voice, face or handwriting recognition.  </p>
<p>But its magic involves adding a few constraints that are particularly relevant to the brain. Here's one example of a constraint: it doesn't allow its estimate of a theme's presence at a given moment to go below zero. Think of it like this - when was the last time you heard an anti-violin? Or had an anti-thought? In other words, PACA breaks the manifold streams of activity in the brain down to just a few that are all present to a greater or lesser degree at each moment.  </p>
