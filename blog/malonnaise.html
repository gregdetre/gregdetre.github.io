      <h2>Malonnaise</h2>

    <p>my emotions are being nice to me at the moment.<br/>
so i'm happy.  </p>
<p>if they turn nasty,<br/>
and the gods and hormones cloud over my happiness,<br/>
then i will take action.  </p>
<p>i will eat more chocolate,<br/>
do more sport,<br/>
talk more with my friends and combat lethargy.  </p>
<p>in all these ways,<br/>
i am both a ship struggling in a stormy sea of emotional turmoil,<br/>
riding the crests and floundering in the troughs,<br/>
at the whim of an elemental rhythm,  </p>
<p>but also a captain and pilot,<br/>
steering the straightest path,<br/>
my hand steadying with age and wisdom,<br/>
contentedness a learned, automaticised skill,  </p>
<p>my friends my lighthouses<br/>
beacons on a shifting coast,<br/>
as i am to them.  </p>
<p>the weather is whimsical,<br/>
whimsy the principle of the world,<br/>
but in harmony with naturalism and narrative,<br/>
somehow my life a story,<br/>
in which i am actor, director and audience all at once.  </p>
<p>i ride the waves,<br/>
the vicissitudes and moods,<br/>
knowing that i have risen above<br/>
and that even though the surf may cause me to splutter,<br/>
until i sink the final time,<br/>
i float.</p>
