        <p><em>Originally published on Medium: <a href="https://gregdetre.medium.com/wikis-are-gardens-d66dff95e35f">Wikis are gardens</a></em></p>
<p>Wikis aren't empty, like the term 'cyberspace' sounds, nor filled with clean, glowing lines, nor grungy and neuromantic.</p>
<p>Wikis are a communal garden, where anyone can graze, and anything can grow. Just like a communal garden, one fears vandalism and internal strife, and one battles against an idealism that can spill into self-righteousness. On the plus side, the devilish generativity and the pleasure of just wandering around and gazing at the flowers tended by many hands is a huge pleasure.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem with wikis is that, perhaps also like gardening, they need regular tending otherwise they turn into a jungle, and they need a structuring vision to decide what should be where.</p>
