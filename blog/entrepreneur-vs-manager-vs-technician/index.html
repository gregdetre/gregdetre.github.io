<h1>Entrepreneur vs Manager vs Technician</h1>






<p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81948.The_E_myth_Revisited">The E-Myth Revisited</a>, Gerber talks about three selves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Entrepreneur dreams of the future, imagining possibilities, and attempting to shape (exercise control over) the world according to that vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Manager attempts to impose order. Perhaps also to understand?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Technician lives for the work, the flow, the present, the building, the joy of craft.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's easy to see elements of all these in myself. At times in my life, I've emphasised one or other, depending on the world and the people around me.</p>
<p>I suppose I get the least personal satisfaction from The Manager. That self eventually emerges as a necessary response to a high level of chaos, or sometimes when trying to impose structure on a team. But I find it takes enormous work to be the Manager for myself.</p>
<p>I've learned to be a Technician, mostly with programming.  Indeed it's a tremendous source of satisfaction, and I feel an urge tugging me towards it at all times. I know I'm not the best Technician at anything, but I'm good enough.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneur comes and goes, and it's very forceful when present.</p>
<p>I'm only a few pages into the book. Perhaps no one likes being a Manager? Or perhaps some people do, and it's necessary in at least small doses?</p>
<p>I have a hunch that his book is aimed at Technicians, whose urge is to focus on that. I'd imagine his point will be that you need a little of all of them...? It's going to be hard. I wonder if I can outsource some of them, or carve out time for each to some degree. I wonder what ratios he will advocate.</p>
<p>UPDATE on 2024-Sept-28 - I first wrote this for myself many years ago. It still feels largely true for me - though I hadn't considered that there is enormous satisfaction to be found as a Manager in helping others to develop.</p>
