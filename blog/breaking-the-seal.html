<h1>Breaking the seal</h1>


<p>I've wanted to try daily writing for an impossibly long time, but the first words didn't want to be dragged out.  </p>
<p>In my case, they were unstoppered by a day in London. I pinballed from train platforms to coffee shops, oblivious bustle all around me, far away from the furrowed-browed finger-pecking at Memrise HQ. That context-shift provided a firebreak from the quotidian, and I was finally in the mood to mentally roll up my sleeves and rub my hands together.  </p>
<p>Writing's like peeing - once you break the seal, the words just spill forth all evening.  </p>
<p>I was able to decant a dozen half-thoughts that I queued up like toy soldiers, to be birthed one by one over the following week. It's now rather fun to receive a blog post from my previous self every day.</p>
