<h1>Welcome, Vegetarians Anonymous - we can cure you</h1>


<p>[man in white coat in a 21st century support group]  </p>
<p>Welcome to Vegetarians Anonymous. If any of you are vegetarian, or think you might be, we can cure you. Apparently, in the early 21st century, they traced vegetarianism back to a stray gene introduced and allowed it to survive by the practice of allowing the most unproductive, undesirable and maladaptive male members of the population to be gainfully employed as sperm donors, fathering the next generation. Clearly, one or more of them was a vegetarian. He wouldn't normally have been able to survive except in our liberal, overly-permissive western societies, and single-handedly spread his rogue seed through the population - it's the equivalent of crapping in the genetic swimming pool</p>
