    <p>This is one of the most frightening articles I've ever read. I haven't got round to checking the facts, and presumably it only makes sense to have a contingency plan. But I'd want it to be a checked and balanced contingency plan, and since this is America, there must be something in the constitution that deals with this kind of situation and imposes a time constraint or requires input from the houses.</p>

<p>"The election is a necessity. We cannot have a free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forgo, or postpone, a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered us."-- Abraham Lincoln, 1864</p>
