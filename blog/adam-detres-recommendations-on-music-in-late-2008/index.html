<p>Fleet Foxes  </p>
<p>Harkness almost to PET SOUNDS - Beachboys. Really pretty laid bak musics ) i even bought the CD cos te album rtwork is great  </p>
<p>Listen to SWAY, he a rapper dude but SAY it TWICE is one of my favourite moern hip hop tracks.  </p>
<p>LAURA MARLING has SUCH pretty voice. So easy to melt into your thoughts while listening to her. my favourite is New Romantic  </p>
<p>NOWon a slightly different note  </p>
