<h1><span class="starred-badge" aria-label="Starred" title="Starred post">★</span>Worst scientific experiment ever?</h1>





<img src="/blog/A cheerful Buddhist monk-scientist running an experiment.png" />


<p><em>Aim</em>: to understand what makes for a good life.</p>
<p><em>Methods</em>: The subject spent two weeks in <a href="https://plumvillage.org/">Plum Village</a>, a Zen Buddhist centre in southwest France. The weather was often sunny. Most of the day was spent outside, surrounded by forest, sometimes farming. The subject lived in a community of 250 people, include monastics, in communal housing. They were assigned to a small group that regularly sat in a circle together sharing from the heart, with occasional catchups in depth with an old friend. They meditated twice a day, walking everywhere at a snail's pace attempting to be mindful, while hearing a lot about bodhisattvas. They drank uncaffeinated tea, ate vegan meals three times a day, and mostly kept silent from late evening until after breakfast. Sources of entertainment included chatting in the tea house, journalling, reading (mostly books by Thich Nhat Hanh), going for a run, lying on the grass, with occasional naps, campfire singalong, and football game.</p>
<p>I’m not saying this is everyone’s cup of tea. And indeed, I often felt bored and restless.</p>
<p>Compare with the control condition: living with my partner in a two-person flat in London, working from home on a computer, and consuming a lot of meat, chocolate, coffee, Netflix, and podcasts.</p>
<p><em>Results</em>: I came away feeling so much happier and more human than when I'd arrived - I am not exaggerating when I say that I felt like a different person. My partner definitely noticed it. And some of the new habits and behaviours stuck, to varying degrees. So let’s consider that to be a pretty enormous effect.</p>
<p><em>Discussion</em>: But I couldn’t help but feel a little frustrated, as a scientist. I had changed almost every single variable you can think of in a human life. So how was I supposed to tell which was most causal, which was the active ingredient? We don’t even know whether we’re talking about one or two variables that matter a lot, or many small effects that add up, or even some kind of multiplicative interaction between them (e.g. perhaps something special happens when you combine meditation with veganism, and then bam!).</p>
<p>Worst scientific experiment ever?</p>
<p>Well, maybe, maybe not. I'll say three things about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It replicated. I went back a year later and had a similar experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was an enormous effect. It’s much easier to work backwards from a large uncontrolled effect to figure out which variables are driving it, than to be stuck tweaking lots of things carefully that don’t make any difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is some information there. Above all, it was a very reassuring reminder that changing environmental factors <em>can</em> change my internal state, in under two weeks. And if I look back at other periods or experiences that have also felt really good, I can start to see which variables are common to them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I went back to Plum Village the second time, I knew that the immediate effects would be temporary. The winds of morale there had gusted me a little way up, so I wanted to grab hold where I could, before rolling back down. The quiet voice inside had been urging changes for a long time, even if it was hard to hear or act on them. For a moment, jolted into a higher, more self-aware energy state, I had extra affordances available to me. I tried to plant seeds that would take root and grow in my life - applying for jobs, signing up for voluntary activities, seeking out communities… We’ll see if it works.</p>
