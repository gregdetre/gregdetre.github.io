<h1>Cringely on the RIAA</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.richardcohen.co.uk/">Richard</a> pointed <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbs.org%2Fcringely%2Fpulpit%2Fpulpit20030724.html">this Cringely piece</a> out to me. Interesting idea for getting round the RIAA. Nobody's done it though, so perhaps it wouldn't have worked out legally after all.  </p>
<p>It does seem too easy somehow. And not the kind of progressive, gradual solution that wouldn't lead to a destructive implosion in the music industry and subsequent dark ages. Or maybe it would lead to a flowering of new songs and unfettered artists. I don't know.</p>
