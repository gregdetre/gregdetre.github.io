<h1><span class="starred-badge" aria-label="Starred" title="Starred post">★</span>I don't believe in luck</h1>






<p>I once told someone glibly that I didn't believe in luck. That triggered a lengthy discussion about being hit by lightning and other instances of unpredictable mishap or serendipity - aren't all of these luck?</p>
<p>I'm closer now to articulating what I meant. <em>I don't believe in systematic chance.</em> Or to put it another way, some people are luckier than others, but this is a function of attitude rather than fortuity.</p>
<p>My dad likes to remind me that 'the harder I work, the luckier I get' [<a href="http://quotationsbook.com/quote/25026/">1</a>,<a href="http://quotationsbook.com/quote/10978/">2</a>]. There's some truth to this - but Lady Luck wants to be serenaded not seed-sown; pan-handled not strip-mined.</p>
<p>Richard Wiseman is the standard-bearer of the scientific study of luck, and he writes beautifully on the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3304496/Be-lucky---its-an-easy-skill-to-learn.html">four characteristics he has identified in lucky people</a> - they:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these principles fits within existing psychological research, but there's something satisfying about seeing them re-inferred and unified in one place through years of questionnaires and experimental studies on the hapful and the hapless.</p>
<p>For fun, substitute 'lucky' for 'entrepreneur' when reading the above 4 points.</p>
