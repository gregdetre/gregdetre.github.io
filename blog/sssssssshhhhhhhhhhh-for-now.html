<h1>Sssssssshhhhhhhhhhh... for now</h1>


<p>I suppose I must really care about <a href="http://gregdetre.blogspot.com/search/label/mobile%20phones">mobile phones ringing</a>, since this is the third piece I've written about it. Maybe it's just that I really care about auditory pollution. Or that it seems like a problem that affects billions of people and hasn't been given enough thought.  </p>
<p>I often want to silence my phone for an hour or so, while in a meeting or class. However, I know that I'll forget to turn the ringer back on afterwards. This is a failure of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_memory">prospective memory</a> ('remembering to remember'), and it's something I feel I have almost no control over.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if one could set one's phone to be silent <em>for an hour</em>, safe in the knowledge that soon after the meeting ended, you'd be back in business? Isn't this what we always want?</p>
