<h1>Dropbocumentation</h1>






<p>Every time a programmer goes away for a few days, a piece of infrastructure they know best breaks. That's just Murphy's Algorithm.  </p>
<p>If they they had only written a 100-word overview with some examples, that would have saved someone else a painstaking day figuring out how things should work, why they suddenly don't, and righting the world once more.  </p>
<p>How do you make it likely that everyone writes down what they know while it's still fresh? Think of edits as conversions (in the analytics sense) - our funnel stretches from signup to viewing to editing, and we want to maximize the number of edits.  </p>
<p>How do we optimize the 'edit' conversion rate for a wiki?  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Editing should happen in the same mode as viewing.</em> If you have to click 'edit', then wait for a page refresh, then scroll down inside a teeny textbox in a browser, then hit save to see your changes ... those steps create a barrier to entry. The conversion rate of views to edits will drop dramatically. Typos, inaccuracies, inscrutabilities and out-of-datenesses will accumulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It needs to be as available as possible.</em> All and only your team can access and contribute to it, even if they're on a different computer or offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Consolidate everything in one or two searchable places.</em> When it's hard to find something, you won't want to start looking. If you have to search one by one through a wiki, your email, a bug tracker, the version control commit log and comments in the codebase, you'll end up just tapping someone on the shoulder - the knowledge will never get planted in a way that it can grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No special knowledge.</em> Wiki markups are confusing and confusable. WYSYWYG editors are a good start - but editing text in most browser textboxes feels like typing with chopsticks. And proprietary document formats are opaque and constricting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No barrier to exit.</em> I want to be able to easily (and ideally automatically) grab a dump of all our documentation, both as a backup and as an export.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After reviewing these possibilities over and over, these are the best solutions I've come up with for Memrise:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>A few monolithic Google Docs.</em> This has worked reasonably well, except that Google Docs still falters in an unwieldy and buggy way when dealing with even medium-sized documents. Boooo!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Etherpad clone</em>. They seem pretty expensive for multi-user monthly subscriptions, and seem weak at linking and searching. Plus, they don't work offline, and I don't trust the companies behind them to be around in 5 years' time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Text files in Dropbox</em>. The main downside to this is that you can't easily inter-link text files, and they lack formatting which makes them ugly to read. But they have no barriers to entry whatsoever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In an ideal world, someone would build a nice (optionally hosted?) wiki solution pulling and formatting Dropbox text files as webpages to give you the best of both worlds, perhaps combined with a few desktop apps and extensions to make offline viewing editing more pleasant.</p>
