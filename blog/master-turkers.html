<h1>Master Turkers</h1>






<p>Amazon's Mechanical Turk is an amazing service where one can create a simple task that can be micro-out-sourced to many people over the web, each of whom performs a small parcel of it. For instance, if you wanted 1000 people to highlight faces in photographs, think of synonyms for words, or provide from-the-hip feedback on your website, Mechanical Turk is ideal.  </p>
<p>For reasons that are unclear to me, people seem to be willing to work for far below a minimum wage performing pretty dull tasks. As an experimental psychologist, I'm torn between feelings of data lust at the number of participants I could thus thriftily recruit, and concern about the quality of their data. What kind of person is willing to engage in dull tasks that must feel meaningless from a worm's eye view? Where's the incentive to do a good job?  </p>
<p>It seems to me that there might be a market for tasks that require more effort, skill or thought, for which one would like to be able to cherry pick the participants. For this to work, you'd need a rich reputation scheme to Mechanical Turk, to pick out the Master Turks.  </p>
<p>I'm picturing myself in holidays as an undergraduate. If someone was willing to pay more £10/hour (roughly what I was earning as a medical secretary), I (or my more talented peers) would have happily:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>researched historical facts for a novel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>proofread a doctoral thesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helped with market research for a business plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>written a catchy jingle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>filmed a youtube video using your product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>written a program to generate verbal reasoning or arithmetic questions for an exam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provided summaries of white papers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You could imagine non-fixed-rate payment schemes, e.g.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a competition where the best submissions divide the spoils</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an auction, so that more enjoyable tasks would be bid lower</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, deliciously, you could create a meta peer-review system where other Master Turkers' task is to rate the submissions you've received.  </p>
<p>Stack Overflow is going to transform the programming job market by making answering people's questions satisfying, and then providing a metric of someone's expertise that will help them land a job.  </p>
<p>There have been many precedents of this kind of idea, but it seems strange that none of them have taken off. This feels like a way to demonstrate one's abilities on potentially interesting tasks that would provide a portfolio of work to supplement a job application.</p>
