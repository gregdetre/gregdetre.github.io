<h1>I refuse to use this technology, even if it would make me money</h1>




<p>There is a new version of Grok, the Elon Musk-owned xAI bot used on Twitter/X coming out later today.  </p>
<p>We were discussing it on a UK AI WhatsApp group that I'm part of, full of some great technologists.  </p>
<p>This AI is sympathetic to Hitler, and producing hate speech. Last time, when it started talking about white genocide, the company acknowledged that was in direct response to a change that someone (they won’t say who) had made to its system prompt.  </p>
<p>I asked "What would it take for each of us to take a stand, and say, "I refuse to use this technology (even if it would make me money)?” and included a link to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb">Guardian article</a>. Responses included:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"I just see it as a bug - we all get them. Theirs is just played out in public to a huge audience."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We are still at the stage of it being a “tool” and as such a tool has good and bad use, but also bugs"  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't want to alienate those people because I feel positively about them as humans, but I want to stand up and say that I don't agree with that view.  </p>
<p>After all, even if we choose to give xAI the benefit of the doubt, and say it’s not deliberate...  </p>
<p>Wouldn’t that suggest then that it’s a sign of a systematically irresponsible, inadequate approach to safety and alignment?  </p>
<p>A genuine question to ask ourselves as technologists: is there anything an AI could say that would make you respond “Hmmm, I’m not willing to use this, even though it's economically valuable"?  </p>
<p>I don’t know whether it’s helpful to create division by calling people out. On balance I think it is more important to point out that we are blurring what I believe should be a clear line in the sand, and to stand publicly on one side of it.</p>
