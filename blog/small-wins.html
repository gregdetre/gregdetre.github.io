<h1>Small wins (list)</h1>




<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn the lyrics to your favourite song, so you can sing along to it as you walk down the street.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil a door handle that's always been just a tiny bit awkward, with a can of WD-40 that has a long nozzle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to a pottery exhibition and buy a mug that feels really good in your hands. Enjoy drinking out of it every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick one of your favourite old books and put it in the bathroom to dip in and out of when you feel like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put just one picture up on the wall. If you don't have picture hooks, buy them now and then you'll be ready next time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice another person in your organisation that you suspect wants to start a fire, and arrange to have lunch with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spray your favourite leather shoes to make them waterproof, and then smile smugly and gratefully next time you accidentally step in a puddle with them on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a playlist of songs that cheer you up, to have ready just in case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry a small Ziploc bag with a couple of tablets of medicines you find useful (e.g. Alka Seltzer for excess, Tums for heartburn, Zirtek &amp; Beconase, for hayfever, Ibuprofen for headaches, Strepsils for sore throats). Replenish when you use one, and add to it when you wish you had something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a list of 'Small wins' of your own, and add the first item to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
