<h1>Spacetime alarms</h1>




<p>Alarm clocks are temporal. They tell you when some time criterion has been reached. They're very useful.  </p>
<p>But often, I really want an alarm with a spatial criterion - a location alarm. Let's consider some possible uses:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Beep shrilly if anyone tries to steal this device from its current location. [I think there are accelerometer-based programs for laptops that do this]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm snoozing on the train - wake me up when we get near Penn Station. [This is where I first came up with the idea].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give me a kick if I'm still in my office when I'm supposed to have left for that meeting. After all, I don't need the alarm to go off if I'm already on my way to the meeting. [though that's a combination space + time criterion]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This would make for an obvious and delightful iPhone app. I haven't found one yet, but I haven't looked hard either.  </p>
<p>UPDATE: there are some really superb suggestions in the comments, and in <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=886000">Hacker News</a> that take this idea much further. I particularly liked these:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://gregdetre.blogspot.com/2009/09/location-alarms.html?showComment=1255731265077#c3881309247552608967">R.J.</a>: Google Maps needs this so when I'm walking down the street I don't have to pay attention to street address numbers/keep my eyes glued to the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=886337">Frankus</a>: Maybe something like that could tell me when I'm close to the grocery store that I need to buy milk.</p>
</li>

<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=886337">Frankus</a>: A game where you try and assassinate your friends by setting imaginary time bombs to go off at a particular location when you think your friend will be there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
