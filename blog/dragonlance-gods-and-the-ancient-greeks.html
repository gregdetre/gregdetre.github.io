      <h2>Dragonlance gods and the Ancient Greeks</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>I just had a thought - the gods in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a> are a lot less irritating and a bit more interesting if you view them as modern fantasy versions of the Ancient Greek gods - their attendant flaws, virtues and very presence provides insight into the whole world view and cultural archetypes of that time. They're also a personification of the morality of the strong. I have to remember to read Martha Nussbaum on this.</p>
