<h1>iThimble</h1>


<p>I have stubby, knobbly hands that look neanderthal to me as I prod sweatily at the smooth, cleanness of my iPhone.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be cool if there was a thimble you could place on your thumbs/index fingers that would give you a restricted surface area with which to press on small buttons on your iPhone?  </p>
<p>Then, I could genuinely use the device as a 21st century post-it note - I wish I could scratch and scribble on it with a horsehair finger-biro, rather than doodling and poodling all over it with my pudgy digits.</p>
