<h1>Things that are still crap about linux</h1>


<p>This should be taken with a pinch of salt because I'm still running RedHat 8, though some things don't appear much better for the Enterprise version  </p>
<p>package manager - I hate downloading new software, because of dependency hell  </p>
<p>X11 - I hate trying to SSH into my lab workstation from anywhere, because I invariably get weird authentication weirdnesses  </p>
<p>why doesn't it have a nice task manager like windows?  </p>
<p>have they sorted out wireless yet?  </p>
<p>what about a media player for .wmv files etc?  </p>
<p>there should only be one copy/paste clipboard  </p>
<p>why isn't konqueror designed to behave exactly like Windows Explorer?  </p>
<p>Update (April 2007): Ubuntu's solved most of these issues, but there are still niggles.</p>
