<h1>What makes a great data scientist and data science team? (Podcast)</h1>




<p>I was recently honoured to be a guest on <a href="https://anchor.fm/data-pubcast/episodes/The-Data-Pubcast--Pint-3-ek3l21/a-a3b42vj?ref=makingdatamistakes.com">The Data Pubcast</a> - a podcast about making data accessible to everyone, hosted by the incredibly talented Nick Latocha and Andy Crossley.</p>
<p><a href="https://anchor.fm/data-pubcast/episodes/The-Data-Pubcast--Pint-3-ek3l21/a-a3b42vj?ref=makingdatamistakes.com">In the episode</a> we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the spectrum of what "data science" means and how knowing that can help you create excellent data science teams [4:10]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maker vs Manager schedules: how to carve out uninterrupted time of deep work for your team [11:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how Data Product Managers can protect the time of those doing "flow state" work [13:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 3 skill categories that every excellent "Machine Learning Engineer" needs [14:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the hardest problems that successful data science teams need to overcome [17:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Engineers: why all successful product data science teams need them [18:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does data democratisation work? (Empowering stakeholders to do analysis themselves) [25:30]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a profound approach to creating an excellent data science team that the rest of the business want to support [30:20]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why "delivery" is the second part of being a great team, and what that involves - including software engineer training, mathematical theory, and why data scientists need to be great communicators who practice and deliver thoughtful feedback to each other [36:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the biggest mistakes I made that had a collossal impact on me (and the solution) [38:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a few organisations that stand out as leaders of data science at the moment [41:49]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why data scientists are expected more and more to prove their worth (and why execs need to believe and support their work) [45:00]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I also answer the 3 questions they ask every guest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What would you tell yourself as a 20-year old to help your data science career? [48:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What #1 training course would you recommend to someone just starting a data career? [51:11]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you could sit down with anyone - dead or alive - who would you want to meet? [54:00]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I really enjoyed <a href="https://anchor.fm/data-pubcast/episodes/The-Data-Pubcast--Pint-3-ek3l21/a-a3b42vj?ref=makingdatamistakes.com">speaking to Nick and Andy, and I hope you enjoy listening</a>.</p>
