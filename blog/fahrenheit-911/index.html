<h1>Fahrenheit 9-11</h1>






<p>I went to see this and thought it was great. I wandered out wondering how anyone could vote Bush after having seen it. It seems quite possible that if enough people see this, it could swing the election. But Moore's journalism is regrettably far from impeccable.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www2.blogger.com/%20http://www.moorewatch.com/">http://www.moorewatch.com/</a>  </p>
<p>Having said that, the Left needs someone vocal, persuasive and with wide reach. I'm not sure that I agree with this quote, but I am starting to agree that what objective journalism there is has failed to get the message across.  </p>
<p>"Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism - which is true, but they miss the point," wrote Thompson. "It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful."  </p>
