<h1>Sanity checks as data sidekicks</h1>


<p>Abe Gong asked for good examples of '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160410165155/http://blog.abegong.com/2014/02/wanted-good-examples-of-data-sidekicks.html?utm_content=bufferdd80e&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">data sidekicks</a>', i.e. <em>"i.e. small, curated data" that "can accelerate analysis, solve cold start problems, and simplify complicated data pipelines"</em>.</p>
<p>My response was <em><a href="https://twitter.com/gregdetre/status/431192954808451073">"brain-data sidekick: sanity-check you can classify blank screen vs stimuli"</a></em> - <em><a href="https://twitter.com/gregdetre/status/431199600033026048">e.g. when classifying mental states with fMRI, if you can't tell stimuli vs none, probably something awry upstream in your pipeline</a></em>.</p>
<p>I still haven't got the hang of distilling complex thoughts into 140 characters, and so I was worried my reply might have been compressed into cryptic nonsense. Here's what I was trying to say:</p>
<p>Let's say you're trying to do a difficult classification on a dataset that has had a lot of preprocessing/transformation, like fMRI brain data. There are a million reasons why things could be going wrong.</p>
<p>All successful analyses are alike, but every unsuccessful analysis is unsuccessful in its own way (sorry, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">Tolstoy</a>).</p>
<p>Things could be failing for meaningful reasons, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the brain doesn't work the way you think, so you're analysing the wrong brain regions or representing things in a different way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there's signal there but it's represented at a finer-grained resolution than you can measure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But the most likely explanation is that you screwed up your preprocessing (mis-imported the data, mis-aligned the labels, mixed up the X-Y-Z dimensions etc).</p>
<p>If you can't classify someone staring at a blank screen vs a screen with something on it, it's probably something like this, since visual input is pretty much the strongest and most wide-spread signal in the brain - your whole posterior cortex lights up in response to high-salience images (like faces and places).</p>
<p>In the time I spent writing this, <a href="https://x.com/AbeGong/status/431201791976288256">Abe had already figured out what I meant :)</a>.</p>
