<h1>How to write proposals that lead to good, quick, collective decisions</h1>




<p>This is a recipe for making <em>good, quick, collective decisions</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write a proposal with: a clear statement of the <em>goals you're trying to achieve</em> (always start with the goals!), your suggested approach, and maybe an argument for why it's a good idea. (A Google Doc is good for this kind of thing, because people can comment asynchronously and avoid meetings.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Trello ticket and <code>@board</code> to let people know you're kicking off a working group. Ask for volunteers to join it (and add themselves to the ticket). Point them towards your proposal, ask for comments, amendments and discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set a clear <em>Due Date</em> on the ticket for when the decision will be made, e.g. 4 business days from now. Leave more time for discussion if the decision will be hard to reverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form a consensus within the working group by the Due Date. If it's an important decision, run the final proposal past the Lead. If you have trouble forming a consensus, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-explains-the-perfect-way-to-make-risky-business-decisions-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T&amp;ref=makingdatamistakes.com">read Jeff Bezos on 'disagree &amp; commit'</a>. Then, announce it to the team, and take responsibility as a working group for making sure it happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to experiment with different rules however you like, and share better ideas for making good, quick, collective decisions. And have fun with it.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Should we use Software X or Y for our Muffin-Baking Machine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's our process for dumping toxic waste into the sparkling water reservoir in future?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-if-were-struggling-to-form-a-consensus">What if we’re struggling to form a consensus?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extend the decision period and keep trying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for evidence to support your arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it's an easy-to-reverse decision, remember that a good decision today is better than a perfect decision tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disagree but commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask me. But you may end up wishing you’d made the decision yourselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
