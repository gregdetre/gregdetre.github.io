        <p>What does it take to run a high-performing data science team? In this 15-minute video, I talk about two tools that Iâ€™ve found invaluable for doing just that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wizard-of-ozzing is a technique for product discovery that can be very helpful for evaluating potential problems to work on [6:00]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centaur teams are for building systems that combine humans and machines - creating something greater than the sum of their parts [9:00]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found these to be two of the most intuitive techniques to help data science teams reliably solve real business problems.</p>
<p>What about you? How do you ensure your team is productively solving real-world business problems? <a href="https://www.makingdatamistakes.com/about/">I would love to hear from you.</a></p>
