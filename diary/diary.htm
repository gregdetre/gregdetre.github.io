<h1><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="TitleRegion" --><font color="#000000">My 
  first few days at Harvard</font><!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h1>
<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion" --> 
<p>Saturday 7th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p>Had a brilliant day - played the most international game of football ever. 
  This is a <a href="statue.jpg">photo</a> of the two Brazilian guys I&#8217;ve spent 
  lots of time with so far. That&#8217;s the statue of John Harvard - all the tourists 
  take photos of this while touching his foot. The undergraduates know this, so 
  every time they get drunk, they take turns to piss all over the base of the 
  statue. It&#8217;s not quite as much fun as pissing on tourists, but almost. Miguel 
  and Marcelo know this story, so if you look very carefully, their hands are 
  hovering a couple of millimetres&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p>sorry i haven&#8217;t written more often, but it has been a truly truly crazy few 
  days, and i&#8217;m very much hoping that things show no signs of calming down. have 
  been to a few bars, spoken at least a little to pretty much everyone on my <a href="entrada.jpg">corridor</a>, 
  had a wander round, blah blah blah. These photos were all taken with Marcelo&#8217;s 
  camera, though I wasn&#8217;t actually even there. These aren&#8217;t my friends. I&#8217;ve broken 
  into his room and stolen them from his hard disk. The reality is that no one 
  here will talk to me at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Monday 9th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p> There were <a href="freshmen.jpg">cheerleaders</a> and I missed it. I am very 
  unhappy about this, and assure you it won&#8217;t happen&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Tuesday 10th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p>the big surprise was that although harvard courses don&#8217;t start for another 
  few days, <span class="caps">MIT</span> courses started the day i arrived. oops. so i&#8217;ve spent today and 
  yesterday charging from one class to another trying to figure out which are 
  best. it looks as though i&#8217;m going to sign up with a crazy man who invented 
  the little round pimple mice on laptops. that&#8217;s pretty fucking cool, as far 
  as i&#8217;m&nbsp;concerned.</p>
<p>Wednesday 11th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p>the <span class="caps">MIT</span> media lab is where geeks end up when they die and go to heaven. the 
  first time i crawled into its air-conditioned multi-colour high-tech sanctity 
  from the hot-as-hell, polluted, people-filled bedlam outside, i genuinely nearly 
  wet myself with excitement. there are massive flatscreen monitors with cool 
  colours and casual people wandering around talking about interesting stuff and 
  wires and lights everywhere. however, classes have been a bit mixed in quality 
  so far, so i&#8217;ve signed up to the one i mentioned above and i&#8217;m going to sit 
  in on a couple of others. it turns out that the rule that even supposedly v 
  bright students can be inane holds true&nbsp;globally. </p>
<p>Thursday 12th Sep&nbsp;2002</p>
<p> i went to see the guy at harvard who does cool things with computers and language, 
  and had yet another of those alarming discussions where we both realised that 
  i know nothing relevant, but where i do my level best to hide it. this is becoming 
  pretty habitual for me now, and, to be honest, i&#8217;m thinking of making it a policy 
  not to learn about anything i do know anything whatsoever about. this seems 
  to me to be either true wisdom or total folly. i&#8217;ll know which for sure in a 
  year&#8217;s time. anyway, so i think i&#8217;ve convinced him to let me take his course, 
  but i&#8217;ve also promised to take at least 2 other hardcore computer science courses 
  in parallel and read a textbook. i am marginally&nbsp;daunted.</p>
