<p><h2>Quickstart</h2></p>
<p class="first">You have <span class="caps">ADHD</span>. Your pulse never drops below 200 beats per
minute and you drink Redbull to calm down. This is the
tutorial for&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>Step 1 - <a href="install.html">download and install freex</a>.</p>

<h3>Creating a&nbsp;journal/scrapbook</h3>

<p class="first">Let&#8217;s say you want to keep a journal, idea-log or scrapbook
of some kind. Maybe you&#8217;re a blogger who wants to keep track
of your ideas for future posts. Or a scientist keeping track
of experimental results. Or a programmer who wants to keep a
log of design and implementation&nbsp;decisions.</p>

<p>You&#8217;d like it to be easy to write things down, but find them
later. You&#8217;d like to be able to tag each entry (or &#8216;nugget&#8217;
as we&#8217;re going to term it), search through them&nbsp;etc.</p>

<p>In emacs, run M-x find-file
&#8220;~/path/to/freex/data/journal.freex&#8221;. Type something
in. Save&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Now type &#8216;journal&#8217;. Notice that it automatically becomes a&nbsp;hyperlink.</p>

<p>Type a couple of entries,&nbsp;e.g.:</p>

<pre class="example">
----
22 October 2007

toilet paper ran out today.

----
23 October 2007

got awarded Nobel Prize today. Again.

----
24 October 2007

still no toilet paper. Good job I'm constipated.

----
25 October 2007

no longer constipated. one problem down, but still no toilet
paper, so I have other problems now.

</pre>

<p>Enough.</p>

<p>Highlight the first entry. Run M-x
freex-embed-define-region-as-nugget, and enter &#8220;journal - 22
October 2007&#8221;.&nbsp;Save.</p>

<p>Notice that the region you highlighted now has a grey
background. You just created a nugget called &#8216;journal - 22
October 2007&#8221; that is embedded within &#8220;journal&#8221;. In other
words, you can have nuggets embedded within other
nuggets. You can run M-x find-file &#8220;journal - 22 October
2007.freex&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll see your entry. Try editing it and
save. Now, go back to &#8220;journal&#8221; and run M-x
revert-buffer. It should have updated to reflect your&nbsp;changes.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s tag our first entry now. Put the cursor inside the
first entry, and run M-x
freex-meta-edit-tag-parents-in-minibuffer. You should see
&#8220;journal/22 October 2007/&#8221;. In other words, your first entry
is tagged with (i.e. belongs to) &#8220;journal&#8221; and &#8220;22 October
2007&#8221;. Let&#8217;s also tag it with &#8220;toilet&nbsp;paper&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now, highlight the second entry, define that as a nugget
just as before, and tag it with &#8220;Nobel Prize&#8221;. Now, Nobel
Prize will show up as a link too, though you might have to
edit the text nearby to make emacs notice that it&#8217;s&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>Highlight the third entry and tag it with &#8220;toilet paper&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;constipated&#8221;.</p>

<p>Close all your buffers. Let&#8217;s pretend that you&#8217;re trying to
find that nugget you wrote about toilet paper and being
constipated so that you can harangue your doctor. Run M-x
freex-meta-find and enter &#8220;toi[<span class="caps">TAB</span>]&#8221;. It&#8217;ll
complete to &#8220;toilet paper&#8221;. We want the nuggets that belong
to &#8220;toilet paper&#8221; though, not &#8220;toilet paper&#8221; itself, so put
in &#8220;toilet paper/[<span class="caps">TAB</span>]&#8221;. If this was a file system, it would
be like saying &#8220;which files are in the &#8216;toilet paper&#8217;
directory?&#8221;. But we&#8217;re not in Kansas any more, as you&#8217;ll
begin to&nbsp;see.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been paying attention this far, then you&#8217;ll see
something like&nbsp;this:</p>

<p><code>
Possible completions are:
toilet paper/22 October 2007/      toilet paper/24 October 2007/
toilet paper/constipated/      toilet paper/journal - 22 October 2007
toilet paper/journal - 24 October 2007
toilet paper/journal/
</code></p>

<p>Think of anything with a &#8220;/&#8221; on the end as a kind of
subdirectory, i.e. a category that you could use to further
whittle down the list of items that belong to &#8220;toilet
paper&#8221;. In this case, you could usefully whittle things down
with the date, or by &#8220;constipated&#8221;, so let&#8217;s try that. Enter
&#8220;toilet paper/constipated/[<span class="caps">TAB</span>]&#8221;. Sure enough, it should
complete to &#8220;toilet paper/constipated/journal - 24 October
2007&#8221;, the only nugget that is tagged with both &#8220;toilet
paper&#8221; and&nbsp;&#8220;constipated&#8221;.</p>
