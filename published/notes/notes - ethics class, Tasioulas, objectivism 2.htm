<h3>1 Some questions about moral disagreements</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>disagreement

</span><![endif]>if the disagreement thesis were true and undermines

those we disagree with?</p>

<h3>2 The disagreement challenge to moral objectivity: a preliminary statement</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>observer
perspective </i>= e.g. in the social sciences (like anthropology), �as
participants in moral practices we make moral judgements, which we suppose have
authority for people�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>participant
perspective</i> = how to live, evaluation of ourselves and others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>perhaps also: that morality is
objective</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a person <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>knows</i> a
moral proposition only if the person believes it, it is true and the person is
justified in believing it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>morality is objective only if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>moral propositions are ordinarily
true or false � i.e. truth-apt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>many moral propositions are true</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>persons have the capacity to be, and
often are, justified in believing moral propositions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moral non-objectivists hold either/both that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>moral propositions are never true</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>no one is ever justified in believing
moral propositions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because agreement is a key indicator of objectivity, the
disagreement thesis, if true, would seriously damage the objectivist cause</p>

<h3>3 A participant perspective: the international human rights movement</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>human rights are thought to have universal authority � i.e.
to provide a standard of moral conduct that applies to all persons and states
in all places, irrespective of cultural differences</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>however, the prevalence of human
rights as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>de facto</i> international
moral standard only dates back recently to the birth of the UN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>but there is question about
whether they apply to non-Western countries, or those without a �cultural
heritage of individualism�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>e.g. the 1993 Bangkok Declaration
of Asian states mainted that human rights must be considered in terms of �the
significance of national and regional particularities and various historical,
cultural and religious backgrounds�</p>

<h3>4 An observer perspective: the views from anthropology</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>anthropology is often considered to support the claims that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the disagreement thesis is true
to a significant extent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>therefore morality is not objective
but relative</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>and therefore we ought to tolerate
the moral practices of other cultures</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we need to consider anthropological data in the light of
three questions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>how accurate are the data?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>do the data show that the Yanamamo
are really so different from �us� morally speaking?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>do the data indicate �moral
disagreements that appear persistently resistant to rational resolution�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gowans argues that evidence from anthropology paints a
complex picture with regard to the disagreement thesis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>19th century anthropologists
viewed �primitive� cultural diversity with regard to an �objective� standard of
European culture</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Boas challenged anthropology to
be more scientific and professional, emphasising the importance of
understanding each culture in terms of its own distinctive values and
circumstances, and through him + his students, anthropology came to be
identified with relativism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>there are at least five ideas
associated with relativism in the anthropological literature:</p>

</span><![endif]>that anthropologists as scientists should strive to be impartial
and hence should not be judgemental about the cultures they study</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

</span><![endif]>that we ought to tolerate the moral values of other cultures</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>now, Linton maintains that �the
resemblances in ethical concepts so far outweigh the differences� that there is
a �sound basis for mutual understanding� between different cultures</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Turner: �transcultural principle
of justice� � individual and collective �right to their differences� so long as
they respect the differences of others</p>

<h3>5 Debates about moral disagreements in the history of Western philosophy</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pyrrhonian skeptic � skeptical about everything, not just
morality � complete suspension of belief (about the real nature of things),
once you realise that for every belief there is as much to be said for it as
against it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aquinas � objectivist foundationalist structure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>first principle: �that good is
to be sought and done, evil to be avoided� is self-evident</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>on this are based all secondary
principles and, ultimately, conclusions for individual actions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>arguments occur when going from the
general to the particular (there are often exceptions), and errors arise out of
sin, passions, wrong persuasions, corrupt habits or customs etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Montaigne revived ancient skepticism, blended with a
day-to-day Catholicism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hume � generally regarded as a skeptic, because he says the
foundation of morality is sentiment rather than reason</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>although he argues that human beings
share �a feeling for the happiness of mankind, and a resentment of their
misery�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>basic moral principle for evaluating
the character traits of a person: their usefulness or agreeableness to the
person or others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>thus, despite denying a rational
foundation to morality, he believed that experience teaches us that human
sentiment is such that there is a moral principle that is universal in the
sense of both being accepted by and applied to all persons</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>like the objectivist accounts,
you have to ask whether Hume really explained the disagreements we find in the
world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nietzsche: philosophers seeking to justify morality
rationally were just �expressing the common <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>faith</i>
in the prevalent morality�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>need to compare many moralities, and
determine the value/origin of each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>discusses master/slave morality (in
BGE) as the ways in which the strong and weak express their WTP</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>in evaluating values, Nietzsche is
concerned not with truth but with their being �life-promoting�</p>

<h3>6 Disagreement arguments against moral objectivity: preliminary clarifications</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>need to distinguish disagreement arguments against moral
objectivity from other arguments:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo14;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>the practical/phenomenological aspects of our moral values (-
they involve feelings and motivate us to act) are difficult to reconcile with
objectivism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo14;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>objective moral values have no cogent/essential place in a
naturalistic picture of the world (peculiar metaphysical properties, play no
crucial role in causal explanations of observations etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.85pt;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo14;
tab-stops:list 35.85pt'><![if !supportLists]>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>reject objectivity in general (e.g. classical skeptical
considerations such as the regress argument showing justification to be
impossible, claims that no sense can be made of the idea that the mind
represents reality, assertions that all beliefs depend on the contingencies of
history and culture, contentions that purported objective beliefs are nothing
but expressions of the WTP etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>different types of disagreements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>usually mid-level judgements of
right and wrong (implications for particular cases, and usually involve
fundamental considerations)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>about the relative importance of
general moral values, about the validity of moral theories, and about
metaphysical or religious understandings of human nature and the world that
figure in moral outlooks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>disagreements can be implicit,
e.g. apparent through different attitudes, actions, priorities etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dilemma = situation in which someone morally ought to (and
can) do one thing, and morally ought to (and can) do another, but cannot do
both � it�s a conflict within a single person</p>

<h3>7 A disagreement argument against objective moral knowledge</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>first premise of the disagreement argument is the
disagreement thesis <span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>(that
there are widespread and deep moral disagreements that appear persistently
resistant to rational resolution)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>in order for morality to be
objective, we have to have the capacity for being justified in believing moral
propositions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>X is a key indicator of Y =</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:53.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>X is non-accidentally related to Y
in an important (causal or logical) respect</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:53.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the absence of X provides strong
presumptive but defeasible evidence for the absence of Y</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>agreement between well-informed,
reasonable persons is a key indicator of the extent to which we have this
capacity for being justified in our moral beliefs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>agreement indicator of
objectivity = tendency of reasonable and well-informed persons to agree in
their beliefs about propositions of a kind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>areas where we feel most
confident about objectivity are those where there is extensive agreement, e.g.
sciences and maths, vs aesthetics or preferences for food</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the agreement indicator of
objectivity appears to be absent in the class of moral propositions, so �we
have strong presumptive but defeasible evidence that it is false that we have
the capacity to be, and often are, justified in believing moral propositions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>you then need to show that the
best overall explanation for the absence of the agreement indicator of
objectivity for moral propositions is moral non-objectivism <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>�/span></span>
morality is not objective</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the three challenges for a proponent of this disagreement
argument are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>establishing the disagreement
thesis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>showing that this gives adequate
grounds for thinking that the agreement indicator of objectivity is absent for
moral propositions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>established that no objective
account of morality is a better explanation than all the non-objective ones
(e.g. anti-realism, skepticism and relativism)</p>

<h3>8 The disagreement thesis</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>two attitudes towards the disagreement thesis:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>some think that the falsehood of
the disagreement thesis can be established a priori</p>

Stevenson�s emotivist argument(???)</p>

margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Davidson�s argument imposes a limit
on the level of disagreement, given that translation is successful, there must
be a broad measure of cross-cultural agreement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:53.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>however, his argument may not be extensible
to moral discourse </p>

margin-left:71.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>firstly, there might be significant
agreement overall with radical disagreement in certain restricted areas</p>

margin-left:71.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>secondly, though there may be common
moral beliefs between two societies, the common moral beliefs may vary from
society to society</p>

margin-left:71.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>thirdly, this all depends on
successful translation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>on the other hand, others think
that empirical investigation is crucial</p>

<h3>Questions � Gowans</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>can a moral realist accept some propositions as truth-apt
and some not??? I suppose the answer is �yes�, as long as he�s able to tell the
difference</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what does it mean to say that one is �justified� in
believing moral propositions???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what are the �epistemic standards� that may be valid only relative
to a culture???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what�s the difference between Pyrrhonian skepticism and
Rortian pragmatism, either in theoretical or practical (�lacking belief was
supposed to ease the anxieties associated with trying to live in accordance
with the truth�) terms???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>whether sentences that ascribe
rightness and wrongness to actions are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>capable</i>
of being true or false</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>if yes, we refute expressivism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>if so, whether any such
sentences ascribing rightness/wrongness to actions really <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>are</i> true</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>if yes, we refute nihilism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>and then we�re committed to moral
realism</p>

<h3>An initial difficulty</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>he then labours a �true strictly-speaking� distinction
(saying that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>p</i> vs saying that �<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>p</i> is true�), since the surface grammar
that anyone with any moral commitments uses appears to entail the sort of moral
realist semantic assent (ascent???) required by those two criteria</p>

<h3>Minimalism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>�the role of the words �true� and �false� is simply to
enable us to register our agreement and disagreement with what people say
without going to the trouble of using all the words that they used to say it�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>i.e. saying that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>p</i> is the same as saying that �<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>p</i> is true� strictly-speaking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thus if you accept the minimalist�s story about truth, and
have any moral commitments at all, then you are a (Minimal) Moral Realist</p>

<h3>The main problem with minimalism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>however, the minimalist�s story is very inadequate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>it fails to tell us what it is
about a sentence that is capable of truth and falsehood that makes it capable
of truth and falsehood, i.e. the conditions that need to be satisfied by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>s</i> in order for �<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>s</i> is true� to be a meaningful sentence in English, i.e. �what
feature of the truth-apt sentences of English makes them truth-apt?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>minimalists argue that purely syntactic features distinguish
truth-apt sentences, e.g. they fit in �John believes that ___��type frames</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Smith uses the example of Caroll�s
nonsense poem �Jabberwocky� to show that syntactically-correct and well-formed
seeming sentences like ��I believe that the slithy toves are gyring and
gimbling in the wabe� is true� have no meaning, and so are incapable of being
either true or false</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>consequently, syntax alone is not
enough to establish truth-aptitude, i.e. moral sentences are not truth-apt just
by virtue of being declarative sentences</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>what would have to happen to �the
slithy toves are gyring and gimbling in the wabe� to make it meaningful?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:53.55pt'>well, �the constituent words in
the sentence would have to be associated with patterns of usage which make it
plain what information about the world people who use the words in those ways
intend to convey when they use them�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:53.55pt'>�in order to be truth-apt,
sentences must be capable of conveying information or giving the content of
people�s beliefs, � or be suitably related by some grammatical transformation
to sentences that could, in principle, be used to give the contents of people�s
beliefs�</p>

<h3>Expressivism and internalism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>for moral sentences to be truth apt, words like �right� and
�wrong� would have to be �associated with patterns of usage that make it plain what
information about the world people�s use of them is intended to convey�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>can we give an account of the
information about the world that the use of such words is intended to convey?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>internalism
constraint</i> - people�s moral views tell us something about their
dispositions to action</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>there is an internal or
necessary conection between the moral judgements we make and our motivations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>thus, there is a constraint on
the proper use of moral sentences (e.g. �torturing babies is wrong�) that
someone who sincerely utters it is averse to tortuing babies (absent
depression, weakness of will etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>expressivists ask what it is about moral sentences, as
opposed to other beliefs (e.g. �snow is white�), that gives them this
motivating force</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>they argue that moral sentences
cannot be used to give the contents of anyone�s beliefs because there are no such
beliefs for anyone to express, since beliefs are states that give information
about the world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>rather, moral sentences express
desire/aversion to an action, rather than a belief-state about that action�s rightness/wrongness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>how else could the use of moral
sentences be constrained by the truth of internalism if their proper use is to
convey information?</p>

<h3>Naturalistic moral realism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>naturalism = the view that the world is (entirely) amenable
to study through empirical science</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Smith reckons that naturalism is very
plausible because of the success of empirical science in explaining various aspects
of the world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>any account of whatever feature of torturing babies it is
that makes it wrong is constrained by our conception of the world in which we
live, which is a naturalistic conception</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>so any form of moral realism
must be naturalistic, i.e. all features that we have reason to believe objects
have must be posits, or composities of posits, of empirical science</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>thus moral sentences�
truth-aptitude supervenes on naturalistic features of the world � �two acts
which are identical in all of their natural features must be alike in their
moral features as well�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>we still need to answer which
natural features warrant the ascription of various moral features to acts</p>

<h3>The �open question argument�</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moore�s open question argument says that just because acts of
a given moral feature always have a certain natural feature does not mean that
the moral and natural feature are the same</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>suppose that �rightness� and
�utility maximisation� were one and the same feature of acts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>then �rightness� and �utility
maximisation� are analytically/<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a
priori</span> equivalent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>�this act maximises utility, but
does it maximise utility?� is a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>closed</i>
question</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>�this act maximises utility, but is
it right?� is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>open</i> question (i.e.
open to reasoned argument)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>thus �rightness� and �utility
maximisation� are not analytic equivalents, i.e. they do not pick out the same
feature</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>no matter which natural features we
choose, it seems that it is never obvious whether an act with such features is �right�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if sound, this has the very strong conclusion that rightness
is not identical with any natural feature of acts at all</p>

<h3>Non-naturalistic moral realism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moore advocated a realm of extra, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>sui generis</i>, non-natural ontological properties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the truth-aptitude of moral
sentences rests on non-naturalistic features/states of the world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but how do we come by knowledge of these �extra, spooky,
non-natural properties� � not by observation, or extension from any
naturalistic knowledge � perhaps by some non-empirical intuitive moral sense?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and why do these non-natural moral properties supervene on
(particular/contingent???) natural properties � might they float free in an
alternative world?</p>

<h3>The open question argument, nihilism and expressivism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>if you discard non-naturalistic moral realism, then the open
question argument appears to say that such non-natural moral features are
nowhere instantiated in actuality, hence all our moral beliefs are false =
nihilism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>alternatively, the open question argument could be seen as a
reductio of the very idea that there are moral features = argument for
expressivism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>however, expressivism may itself
also be vulnerable to the open question argument</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>since it says that �Michael judges
that torturing babies is wrong� is analytically equivalent to the naturalistic
claim that �Michael expresses his aversion to torturing babies�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>however, �Michael expression
expresses his aversion to torturing babies, but does he judge that torturing
babies is wrong?� is not a closed question, and so �expressing his aversion to
�� and �wrong� are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not</i> one and the
same (analytically equivalent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>if sound, the open question refutes
expressivism by showing that Michael�s judging it wrong to torture babies isn�t
analytically equivalent to any natural feature of Michael either</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the open question argument has now ruled out the three
options which we said covered all the possibilities � so the open question
argument itself must be unsound</p>

<h3>The naturalistic moral realists� first response to the open question argument</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>the problem with the open question argument may lie in the
claim that �rightness� and �the property of maximising utility� (for example)
are not analytically/<span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a priori</span>
equivalent, i.e. that they pick out different features</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>e.g. water is not analytically/<span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>a priori</span> equivalent to H<sub>2</sub>O,
but we know a posteriori that water <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i>
H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>thus it might be an a posteriori
truth (discoverable through observation + inference) that �rightness� and �the
property of maximising utility� are identical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>so then naturalistic moral
realists have to show how/why the natural and moral feature are a posteriori
equivalent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>arguably, we label a given
empirical phenomena right/wrong, and then look for a moral feature which fills
this role, e.g. disvoer that the feature that is causally responsible for acts
that we consider to be �right� is the maximisation of utility, then we conclude
that rightness is the property of maximising utility</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>supposedly, this is like fixing
the reference of �redness� to the description �the property of objects,
whatever it is, that causes them to look red to normal pereivers under standard
conditions�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:53.55pt'>the difference is, and the
reason that this a posteriori explanation is inadequate, is that we can�t fix
the reference for rightness in the same a priori way that we can for redness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:53.55pt'>I think Smith is saying that to
say that we know in advance which empirical phenomena are right and which are
wrong in advance (i.e. before figuring out what the common feature is which we
label the moral feature, e.g. maximising utility) is begging the question</p>

<h3>The naturalistic moral realists� second response to the open question
argument</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>we should reconsider what we mean by analyticity. it should
not be judged by the obviousness of the analysis, or whether it�s open to
reasoned argument</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>in the case of �redness�, the analytic
equivalent that we seek is something that captures a complex set of
constraints, i.e. the properties that cause us to have those certain visual
experiences, most reliably detected in the daylight, subject to defect in one�s
eyes etc. = �the property of objects that causes them to look red to normal
perceivers under standard conditions�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>thus, analyticity allows for
reasoned argument in determining the complex set of constraints on the use of
the word being analysed and whether or not this complex set is entailed by the
proposed analysis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>if we accept this account of
conceptual analysis, then Moore�s law is too stringent and fails to refute the
equivalence between �rightness� and a given natural feature, and the naturalistic
project is back on track</p>

<h3>Externalist naturalistic moral realism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>externalist realism = �the view that though we can, by
reflecting on the ways in which we use moral words, find a naturalistic
equivalent for the term �rightness�, the naturalistic equivalent we come up
with will leave it completely open whether someone who believes an act to be
right will desire/be indifferent/averse to performing that act�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>I think this means that we can
find a way of reducing/translating moral features into natural features (and
vice versa), but this adds no motivation for acting on the moral beliefs that
this leads us to hold (or that we hold already)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>externalist realists must:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>show why the particular
natural/moral feature equivalence they propose is correct, i.e. that the way in
which we use moral words corresponds to that moral/natural
translation/reduction system, i.e. �rightness� (like the term �electron�)
�serves to pick out a feature in virtue of the characteristic causal role that
that feature occupies�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>they also have to explain why we
think we have the internalist constraint, i.e. why possession of a moral belief
brings a desire to perform that act (absent depression, weakness of will etc.),
since this isn�t really explained/accounted for by the externalist theory at
all � it divorces (and makes mysterious) the connection between explanatory
role (what acts are �right�) and justificatory potential (why we should do what
is �right�)</p>

<h3>Internalist naturalistic moral realism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>internalist realism = (like external realism) �we can
characterise rightness in terms of its distinctive explanatory role, but the
explanatory role characteristic of rightness is, broadly speaking, that of
eliciting desire under certain idealised conditions of reflection�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>i.e. the natural feature common to
all �right� acts is whatever we would desire to do given idealised conditions
of reflection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>e.g. �rightness� = that feature,
whatever it is, that we would desire our acts to possess if our desires formed
a set that is maximally informed, coherent and unified � the internal realist
claims that this analysis of rightness reflects the way in which we use moral
words</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the justificatory potential of
this characterisation of rightness derives from the fact that any belief about
the �right� action <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> what we would
desire ourselves to do in those circumstances if our desires were immune to
rational criticism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>he thinks this fits well with our
use of �right� as being settlable a priori</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>he also thinks that the
justificatory potential/motivation to do the �right� thing derives from a
rational pressure to do what you would do if your desires were maximally
informed/coherent/unified etc. (which = �right� according to internal realism)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>they argue that the fact that
depression, weakness of will affect our choosing to do the �right� thing for
exactly this reason, i.e. that it is because we are at the opposite end of a
coherent, informed + unified set of desires when depressed/weak-willed that we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don't</i> do the right thing (i.e. because
of psychological incoherence)</p>

<h3>Should an internalist naturalistic moral realist be a relativist?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>does the �we� in internalist realism refer to all rational
creatures? i.e. should we all converge in the desires that we would have under
idealised conditions of reflection, or will culturally-induced discrepancies make
for contingently different rational choices? if so, then the theory is
relativistic</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relativistic internalist realism = a subset of rational
creatures (those who have desires like our own) are such that they would desire
that we act in that way under idealised conditions of reflection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>but other perfectly rational creatures
may differ from us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>non-relativistic internalist realism = their having
corresponding desires as part of their idealised desire set is required for the
theory to be true</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smith doesn't like the relativistic account, since he
doesn't think that rationally optional culturally induced desires could affect rightness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the non-relativistic account holds
that the grounding of rightness is non-arbitrary, and consequently universal,
as a result of our shared status as rational beings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>however, it depends on us having
a set of desires that is maximally informed, coherent and unified � �thus we
won't be convinced about even this version of moral realism unless we are
confident that the arguments we give ourselves for desiring as we do are
arguments that should convince the arbitrary rational person to desire likewise�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there are no objective values (moral scepticism/subjectivism

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>first order moral subjectivism �

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>or the doctrine that �this

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Mackie�s moral subjectivism is a
negative doctrine, rather than a positive one like this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>his is an ontological rather than
linguistic or conceptual thesis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>indeed, emotivists presuppose a
lack of objectivity in values, although conversely of course a lack of
objectivity does not entail that all moral statements are just subjective
reports</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there are then several types of second order moral question
� usually re: meaning + use of ethical terms or the analysis of ethical
concepts or the logic of moral statements + arguments</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hare says he does not know what it means to talk of the
�objectivity of values�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>he asks what the difference is
between a world with only subjective values, and one where values are built
into its fabric objectively, remembering that there is no difference in the
subjective concern people have for things�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mackie argues that the objectivity of values would certainly
not affect people�s subjective concerns, but that this point only reiterates
the distinction between 1st and 2nd order ethics: 1st order judgements are not
necessarily affected by the truth or falsity of a 2nd order view</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>he says that the world with
objective values is different, because there is something that backs up and
validates people�s subjective concerns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Hare�s example excludes the
possibility that in the objective world, the people might tap into the
objectivity of their world in deciding upon their subjective concerns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there is more to objectivity of value than universal
agreement (i.e. mere intersubjectivity), or universalisability (that everyone
could/should follow the same prescription)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he contrasts objectivism and descriptivism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>descriptivism: the meanings of
ethical terms and statements are purely descriptive, not even partly
prescriptive or evaluative</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>this is in contrast with the
Platonic forms, for instance, where the values in the Form of the Good are
real, and the sight of them is enough to ensure adherence to them without
further motivation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>for many such philosophers,
values are objectively prescriptive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps Hare�s difficulty with the �objectivity of values�
is a difficulty in imagining how values can be part of the fabric of the world</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>such an objectivity of goodness would allow us to refute 1st
order egoism � however, the objectivity of rationality would not help (<span

<p class=MsoNormal>alternate restatement of objectivity of values is to say
that values cannot be true or false</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>but, even in a world without
objectivity of values, there are values with clearly defined criteria which can
be true or false (e.g. marking of exams, skating + diving championships), in
relation to agreed and assumed standards</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>however, the standards by which
even such structured value-judgements operate are themselves only partly

<h2>Notes � Harman, chs 1-3 in The Nature of Morality</h2>

<h3>Ch 1 � Ethics and observation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>can moral principles be tested and confirmed in the way that
scientific principles can?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>scientific hypotheses can
usually be tested in real experiments in the real world (although observations
are always �theory-laden� to at least some extent, because forming a belief
from a perception requires/involves understanding the relevant concepts by virtue
of their role in some theory or system of beliefs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the difference between the role of observation in science
and in ethics is that �you need to make assumptions about certain physical
facts to explain the occurrence of the observations that support a scientific
theory, but you do not seem to need to make assumptions about any moral facts
to explain the occurrence of the so-called moral observations I have been
talking about. In the moral case, it would seem that you need only make
assumptions about the psychology or moral sensibility of the person making the
moral observation. In the scientific case, theory is tested against the world.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>�The observation of an event can
provide observational evidence for or against a scientific theory in the sense
that the truth of that observation can be relevant to a reasonable explanation
of why that observation was made. A moral observation does not seem, int eh
same sense, to be observational evidence for or against any moral theory, since
the truth or falsity of the moral observation seems to be completely irrelevant
to any reasonable explanation of why that observation was made. The fact that
an observation of an event was made at the time it was made is evidence not
only about the observer but also about the physical facts. The fact that you
made a particular moral observation when you did does not seem to be evidence
about moral facts, only evidence about you and your moral sensibility.�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>�Certain moral principles might
help to explain why it was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>wrong</i> of
the children to set the cat on fire, but moral principles seem to be of no help
in explaining <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>your thinking</i> that that
is wrong�</p>

<h3>Ch 2 � Nihilism and naturalism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>extreme nihilism = morality is simply an illusion: nothing
is ever right or wrong, just or unjust, good or bad, perhaps even merely a
superstitious remnant of religion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moderate nihilism = the purpose of moral judgements is not
to describe the world but to express our moral feelings or to serve as
imperatives we address to ourselves and others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>naturalism = the sensible thesis that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>all</i> facts are facts of nature</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ethical naturalism = the doctrine that moral facts are facts
of nature</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>there are moral facts and they can
be �reduced� to natural facts of a sort that might explain observations (in the
way that facts about colour might be reduced to facts about physical
characteristics of objects, the properties of light and the perceptual
apparatus of an observer)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>and since the first question is an
open question while the second is not, the natural characteristic of being an
act that is C cannot be equated with the moral characteristics of being an act
that ought to be done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>to defend against the �open question
argument�, you can try and show that the first question is not necessarily
open, e.g.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>�I agree that, if P does D, P will
satisfy the relevant interests, but ought P to do D?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>more importantly, the �open
question argument� is invalid, e.g. it is not an open question whether water is
water, but it is an open question whether water is H<sub>2</sub>O � even though
water <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>is</i> H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>so, even though moral judgements do not seem to help explain
observations, there could still be moral facts if these facts were reducible in
some way or other to other facts of a sort that might help explain observations
(like colour facts), i.e. a naturalistic reduction of moral facts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>reducing moral facts to facts
about interests, roles and functions would be complex, vague and difficult to
specify</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the problem with reducing moral
facts is that it is difficult, and does not seem ever to be useful in practice
in our explanations of observations</p>

<h2>Notes � McDowell, �Values and secondary qualities�</h2>

<h2>Notes � Rorty, hodgepodge</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Truth is &quot;what it is better for us to believe� (James)
rather than �the accurate representation of reality�. Or, the notion of
�accurate representation� is really only a preference for �those beliefs which
are successful in helping us do what we want to do�. This is part of his
pragmatist conception of knowledge which �eliminates the Greek contrast between
contemplation and action, between representing the world and coping with it�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�The picture which holds traditional philosophy captive is
that of the mind as a great mirror, containing various representations � some
accurate, some not � and capable of being studied by pure, non-empirical
methods�, with Descartes and Kant seeking knowledge (more accurate
representations) by inspecting and polishing the mirror (through �conceptual
analysis�, �phenomenological analysis�, �explication of meanings�, examination
of �the logic of our language� or of �the structure of the constituting activity
of consciousness�). Wittgenstein�s �post-positivistic� stance in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Philosophical Investigation</i> mocked these
attempts. In Dewey�s ideal society, �culture is no longer dominated by the
ideal of objective cognition but by that of aesthetic enhancement�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>��Truth� is the will to be master of the multiplicity of
sensations� (Nietzsche). �The �true� is simply the expedient in the way of
believing� (James). Kuhn thought that �science should not be thought of as
moving towards an accurate representation of the way the world is in itself�. �<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Truth is correspondence to the intrinsic
nature of reality</i>� (Plato). Pragmatists never call themselves relativists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �correspondence theory of truth� � obvious and
self-evident? or barely intelligible, of no particular importance, and �just
one philosophical view among others�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Objective� � i.e. found or discovered, �in some sense out
there waiting to be recognised by us human beings�? or �really made or
invented�?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But Rorty can�t accept the making/finding distinction, otherwise
�Have we <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>discovered</i> the surprising
fact that what was thought to be objective is subjective, or have we <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>invented</i> it?� �If truths are merely
convenient fictions, what about the truth of the claim that that is what they
are?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty wants to stop using the finding/making,
objective/subjective, nature/convention, real/apparent and absolute/relative
vocabulary and distinctions. But some opponents suggest �that to be rational
consists precisely in respecting these distinctions�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A belief is a �habit of action� (Peirce). It is merely to
say that there is no point in asking whether a belief represents � either
mental or physical reality�. Rather, we should ask, �For what purposes would it
be useful to hold that belief?�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The argument should �not be about which of us has got the
universe right�. �We cannot regard truth as a goal of inquiry�. �The purpose of
inquiry is to achieve agreement among human beings about what to do, to bring
about consensus on the ends to be achieved and the means to be used to achieve those
ends.� �All areas of culture are parts of the same endeavour to make life
better. There is no deep split between theory and practice�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�To treat beliefs not as representations but as habits of
action, and words not as representations but as tools, is to make it pointless
to ask, �Am I discovering or inventing, making or finding?��</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(I)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>� </span>... elements of
what we call 'languge' or 'mind' <i>penetrate so deeply into what we call
'reality' that the very project of representing ourselves as being 'mappers' of
something 'language-independent' is fatally compromised from the start</i>.
Like Relativism, but in a different way, Realism is an impossible attempt to
view the world from nowhere (RHF 28)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(II)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>[We should] accept
the position we are fated to occupy in any case, the position of beings who
cannot have a view of the world that does not reflect our interests and values,
but who are, for all that, committed to regarding some views of the world -
and, for that matter, some interest and values - as better than others (RHF
178).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(III)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>����� </span>What Quine
called 'the indeterminacy of translation' should rather be viewed as the
'interest relativity of translation'... 'Interest relativity' contrasts with
absoluteness, not with objectivity. It can be objective that an interpretation
or an explanation is the correct one, given the interests which are relevant in
the context (RHF 210).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(V)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>To say, as
[Bernard] Williams sometimes does, that convergence to one big picture is
required by the very concept of knowledge is sheer dogmatism ... It is, indeed
the case that ethical knowledge cannot claim absoluteness; but that is because
the notion of absoluteness is incoherent (RHF 171)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty argues that Putnam is plain wrong about this, and that
in fact he has &quot;urged that we continue to speak with the vulgar while
offering a different philosophical gloss on this speech than that offered by
the realist tradition&quot; and &quot;complained over and over again about
Heidegger's and Derrida's overestimation of the cultural importance of
philosophy&quot;. (Rorty)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;For pragmatists like Putnam and me, the question
should always be 'What use is it?' rather than 'Is it real?' or 'Is it
confused?'.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;our norms and standards of warranted assertibility ...
evolve in time&quot; (Putnam).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty thinks that &quot;matter of fact&quot; must mean more
than just &quot;our ability to figure out whether S was in a good position,
given the interests and values of herself and her peers, to assert p&quot;,
that it must mean &quot;whatever makes it possible for a statement not to be
warranted even though a [vast] majority of one's peers say it is&quot;. This
must require &quot;some natural order of reasons which determines, quite apart
from S's ability to justify p to those around here, whether she is *really*
justified in holding p&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;truth as idealised rational acceptability&quot;. What
can this mean except &quot;acceptability to an ideal community&quot;, which can
only mean &quot;*us* [&quot;educated, sophisticated, tolerant, wet
liberals&quot;] as we should like to be&quot;. This is what he means by saying
&quot;that pragmatists should be ethnocentrists rather than relativists&quot;.
What alternative does Putnam have, given that he doesn't want to follow
Williams and Peirce in saying that &quot;the notion of knowledge entails that
of convergence to a single result&quot;. Similarly, we're not allowed to use
'idealized' to refer to &quot;a process built into any and every inquiry ...
which will guide us ... along convergent lines&quot;. Without that, &quot;the
terms 'warranted', 'rational acceptability' etc. will always invite the
question, 'to whom?'&quot;. Surely just &quot;us at our best&quot;?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is arguing that we should choose our standards of
warranted assertability on the basis of how good they will come to seem to
us-at-our-best (the idealised wet liberals we would like to be), rather than in
Putnam's terms of 'idealised rational acceptability'. This will not satisfy
necessary or sufficient conditions for a view/theory/practice being better,
&quot;for the usual 'naturalistic fallacy' reasons&quot;. We should set aside
'better' and �true', and just ask &quot;which explications raise more problems
than they solve&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This anti-Rorty argument is attributed to Putnam by
Williams: &quot;[Rorty's views] simply tear themselves apart. If as Rorty is
fond of putting it, the correct description of the world (for us) is a matter
of what we find it convenient to say, and if, as Rorty admits, we find it
convenient to say that science discovers a world that is already there, there
is simply no perspective from which Rorty can say, as he also does, that
science does not really discover a world that is already there, but (more or
less) invents it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty responds in various ways, arguing that Williams has
conflated two claims, one of which is a &quot;straw-man claim&quot; that
&quot;there were no dinosaurs or atoms before we 'invented' them&quot; which is
&quot;not entailed by anying in I-V above&quot;. Moreover, there will be things
that are even more convenient to say in the future that supercede the ideas
that Williams lists as being currently convenient. The metaphilosophical
question about pragmatism doesn't centre on what the most convenient beliefs it
is currently holding are, but &quot;whether there is something other than
convenience to use as a criterion in science and philosophy&quot;, where
&quot;'convenience' in this context means something like: ability to avoid
fruitless, irresolvable, disagreements on dead-end issues&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty's strategy to &quot;[escape] the self-referential
difficulties into which 'the Relativist' keeps getting himself is to move
everything over from epistemology and metaphysics to cultural politics, from
claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to suggestions about what we
should try&quot;, but Putnam does not adopt it. &quot;At the last moment, it
seems to me, he turns intuitionist&quot;, even though he concedes that we might
&quot;behave better if we became Rortians - we may be more tolerant, less prone
to fall for various varieties of religious intolerance and political
totalitarianism&quot;, which is exactly what Rorty wants. Putnam wants to know
why, if these are Rorty's goals, why he doesn't argue directly for them - Rorty
responds that this is just the sort of approach that someone who &quot;thought
of philosophy as the pedestal on which culture rests&quot; would take...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Putnam accuses Rorty of secretly saying that &quot;from a
God's-Eye View there is no God's-Eye View&quot;. Rorty doesn't understand what
the difference is between what he says about 'better' and Putnam's I-V, that
they are both just &quot;criticising accepted cultural norms and
standards&quot; by suggesting alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty reckons that Putnam's main problem lies with Rorty's
Darwininism, e.g. a naturalistic account of reason. They both dismiss the idea
that we have evolved to track truth and &quot;represent it accurately&quot;,
&quot;as opposed to merely coping with it cleverly&quot;. Then Putnam dismisses
Foucault and Rorty as 'cultural relativists', &quot;who want to reduce 'better'
to consensus, and thus are unable to offer rational criticism of a prevailing
consensus&quot; (&quot;reductionism and historicism&quot;). Putnam concludes
that &quot;as thinkers we are committed to there being *some* kind of truth,
some kind of correctness which is substantial and not merely 'disquotational'.
That means that there is no eliminating the normative&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rorty thinks that Putnam runs together the question 'Can we
give necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of normative
expressions?' with 'Does our familiar use of normative expressions show that
there is &quot;some kind of correctness which is substantial&quot; (or that
&quot;the rightness or wrongness of what we say is not *just* for a time and a
place&quot;)'? Rorty thinks 'no' to both questions. &quot;I think that nothing
about the substantiality or atemporality of correctness follows from the
irreducibility of a set of expressions to one another&quot;(???). Rorty points
out again that &quot;nonlocal correctness of assertion&quot; requires denial of
one or more of I-V, i.e. metaphysical realism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Putnam's claim that &quot;reason can't be
naturalised&quot; seems to me ambiguous between an uncontroversial but
inconsequential truth about irreducibility and a false claim that the Darwinian
story leaves a gap in the fabric of causal explanation&quot;(??? - pg 20).
Rorty agrees that &quot;reason is both transcendent and immanent&quot; because
&quot;all I can mean by 'transcendent' is &quot;pointing beyond our present
practices, gesturing in the direction of our possibly different future
practices&quot;, but Putnam seems to mean more than this (&quot;philosophy, as
culture-bound reflection and argument about eternal questions, is both in time
and eternity&quot;). Rorty thinks Putnam is &quot;running together our ability
to use tensions with our present body of beliefs of desires to put anything
(including our present norms and standards for warranted assertibility) up for
grabs with our ability to achieve a rightness that is &quot;not just for a time
and a place&quot;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately, Rorty thinks they disagree about &quot;how much
can be saved from the realist tradition once we affirm I-V&quot;. Putnam thinks
there is &quot;room for something like the Apel-Habermas notion of a �universal
validity claim�&quot;, &quot;nonlocal and nontransient rightness&quot;, whereas
Rorty wants &quot;to experiment with an image of ourselves (i.e. us wet
liberals) as as local and transient as any other species of animals, yet none
the worse for that&quot;.</p>

<h2>Points</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>To begin with, I�m going
to set out a number of premises, of roughly increasingly stringency, so that
different theories can be compared in terms of how objective an ethical picture
they are painting.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;mso-list:l7 level1 lfo11;
     tab-stops:list .5in'>Moral statements such as �Doing X is right/wrong�
     have truth values</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;mso-list:l7 level1 lfo11;
     tab-stops:list .5in'>Even though moral statements do have truth values, we
     may never be able to know what their truth value is</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;mso-list:l7 level1 lfo11;
     tab-stops:list .5in'>Even though moral statements do have truth values, their
     truth value is usually �false�</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I�m then going to differentiate between the terms �absolute�
and �objective�, and argue that rejecting an absolute ethical objectivism still
leaves room for a relativistic ethical objectivism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>even relativism could have an objective virtue-theory-like
function translating from input circumstances, customs + biology to moral value
of act</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>individualism + rights</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if brought up in the right way (i.e. maximally exposed +
educated) most people would probably choose some sort of super-Western ideal, which
the world is converging upon</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>structure using arguments from queerness and relativity, and
any other anti-realist arguments I can find</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the argument from relativity is unimportant, because it
scores an epistemological not a metaphysical point � the reason we all disagree
need not be at all relevant to whether or not there are objective moral facts,
but whether or not we have access to them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>perhaps this is a third question
that moral realists have to address � given that moral sentences are truth-apt,
and that at least some of them are true, can we have access/knowledge of this
truth???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>feminist critiques of moral objectivism are covered under
relativism and biology, as a sort of experiment on disagreement with close-to-home
aliens</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>If I�m successful at that, then
next week I�ll look at truth and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>They broadly divide into two
camps: the objectivist, realist, cognitivist, naturalist and the
non-objectivist, relativist, pluralist, subjectivist, skeptic or anti-realist.
The divisions between these are by no means hard and fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>Words like �objective� and
�true� play such a critical role in the debate that I will briefly try and
distinguish them from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides this wealth of inter-related theories, there a
number of concepts that need to be disambiguated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In such a situation, the open question argument could even
be used as a reductio of the very idea that there are moral features.
However,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>I won't go into the details
here, but Smith shows that, if sound, the open question argument can equally
well dismiss the expressivist just when he was feeling smug at the naturalist�s
expense (since it can be used to dismiss any natural feature, including the
moral emotions equivalent to �boo� and �hurray� that are a feature of the
expressivist agent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>hang on � doesn't it leave
non-cognitivism/relativism unharmed though???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider a very simple example: if faced with the choice of
saving the life of three old, unhappy, lonely people or one young, friendly
social worker engaged to be married with a brilliant idea for a cure for cancer
(just to labour the point), the (act) utilitarian doctor might, in this rare
case, sacrifice three patients for the health of one. From the outside, this
choice might be mystifying if all the circumstances relating to the particular
application of the rule were not known, and it might seem as though this
particular doctor was acting according to quite different rules. This can be
easily developed into a relativist argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, this requires one to consider just what sort of
circumstances might be so different from one culture to another. Certainly
different cultures could be at <span style='color:blue'>different stages of the
economic development cycle or different climates, and so have different levels
of prosperity per capita. </span></p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>what is meta-ethics???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can we explain how mere cognitive moral beliefs have
motivating force by adding a belief to the effect that �I should act to further
my beliefs�???</p>

<h3>Nagel</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nagelian �objective� vs agreed/universal/convergent</p>

<h3>Wiggins</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>thick vs thin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>why does he prefer �moral cognitivism� to �moral realism�???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>difference between the five different types of relativism???</p>

<h3>Smith</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>do non-cognitivists have to argue that our moral statements
are not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intended</i> to be about the way
the world is, or can they just argue that wittingly or unwittingly they <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>aren�t</i> about the way the world is???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>expressivism and nihilism both see the world as being
value-free and devoid of any moral nature � is this like Mackie�s point,
insofar as nihilism is making a first order claim about values, and
expressivism is making a second order claim about values</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when he says �semantic ascent�, surely he means �semantic
assent�???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>why can�t the minimalist just stipulate that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>s</i> must be a declarative sentence (i.e.
�I believe that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>s</i>� must form a
meaningful sentence)???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>see the argument about
Jabberwocky</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�the constituent words in the sentence would have to be
associated with patterns of usage which make it plain what information about
the world people who use the words in those ways intend to convey when they use
them� � are we actually able to do this for all of the (especially
complicated/abstract) words that we do consider meaningful???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where does this formulation of his, �associated with
patterns of usage that make it plain what information about the world people�s
use of them is intended to convey�, come from??? is it intended as a
general-purpose definition of the �meaning� of a word??? does it work, given
that every word (and its associated pattern of usage) is inter-defined with
every other word??? plain??? in fact, doesn�t the phrase �information about the
world� more or less require (implicitly) a naturalistic explanation of �right�
and �wrong�???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>isn�t the notion of analyticity extensible to �anything that
can be shown to mean the same thing, even after reasoned argument�???
otherwise, practically nothing in the world is analytic, surely???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smith says that the externalist realist has to explain what
it is about the way in which we use moral words that shows their moral/natural
feature equivalence to be the right one � doesn�t this assume that we all, at
root, use moral words in the same way???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>yes, of course it does, that�s what
being a moral realist is more or less all about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>but is there any way to be a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>pluralist</i> moral realist??? does that
even make sense???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:35.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>that�s kind of what relativism is,
insofar as it�s kind of objective in a limited way, but not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>absolute</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is internal realism saying that �rightness� consists in
those acts which elicit desire under certain idealised conditions of
reflection??? what about people like Hitler, who spent ages honing Mein
Kampf???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he doesn't leave any room for epistemological barriers, i.e.
that there may be a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>right</i> action that
we can't decide on, or two equally right actions, does he???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>does moral realism leave room
for there being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>some</i> moral sentences
which aren't truth-apt??? some acts are morally indifferent, after all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>what about degrees of right???
does the rightness apply to all rational beings � what about those who seek
death as honour, or something???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�however, it depends on us having a set of desires that is
maximally informed, coherent and unified� � what�s he saying here???</p>

<h3>Routledge</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike the non-cognitivist, the subjectivist views ethical
claims as truth-apt, but as being true in virtue of facts about human desires
or inclinations (Routledge) - this seems v close to a form of non-absolute
objectivism???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is more objective than 'i think it is right to help
people in distress' (the most extremely subjectivist statement) to say 'it is
right for people to help people in distress' - after all, who's to say what's
right for a martian with an amplifying empathetic faculty who might distress
himself to death by their proximity???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in order for something to be truth-apt (i.e. please a
cognitivist), does it have to posit some metaphysical truth???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what's antirealism or skepticism??? nihilism??? where did
Nietzsche stand in relation to all of this???</p>

<h3>Mackie</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>does Nagel think we should bother with 2nd order statements
at all???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pinkers shows that we all make certain kinds of mistakes in
our reasoning, e.g. in probability, and indeed have proved many things to be
counter-intuitive yet correct � doesn�t this show that our �rational� faculties
take shortcuts in lots of situations � how can we havea ny confidence that our
reasoning is ever objectively valid???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>well, for starters, it�s
reasoning that has shown certain counter-intuitive things to be true � that
higher form of reasoning is the one philosophers employ</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how does Mackie define objective values (�in our sense�) to
exclude sheepdog trials???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>not in fabric of the world, but
only relative to semi-subjective/indeterminate criteria � but what else???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could it be that answering the fundamental question of
ethics, �How should one live?�, is best approached in terms of attitudes rather
than virtues (which presuppose some sort of metaphysical biology, don�t
they???)???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can�t we look to the Kantian/Enlightenment project to access
objective values through reason, rather than intuition??? but how, is the
question�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Plato�s Euryphro dilemma</p>

<h3>McDowell</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>when he talks about the mind projecting itself onto the
world, e.g. fearfulness, how far can we take this idea that the fearfulness
does (to some extent) supervene(???) on natural facts, but is clearly projected
too � this seems very very appropriate in comparison to morality�</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what�s the difference between colour and right??? what�s all
that stuff about secondary qualities and Mackie???</p>

<h3>Rorty/Putnam</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>where can I find out more about anti-cognitivist positions,
specifically attacking the idea that moral truths can be expressed in
language??? </p>
