<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>L&amp;C
V � Lexical Processing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lexical processing refers to recognising a word and its
meaning both in spoken and written form. This means identifying the words in
whatever form they are presented and bringing up their associated syntactic and
semantic information. This requires separating the auditory or visual input
into words, on the basis of pauses/gaps and other features of the signal. Most
of the experimental work is conducted on written, as opposed to spoken input,
because the printed word allows us to control for speaker variations,
pronounciation, dialect, noise etc. This is all <i>perceptual</i> information. Information
like the topic of discussion, accompanying images (e.g. in an advertisement),
cultural norms etc is <i>contextual</i> information. Lexical processing is one
of the early steps in language: in comprehension it involves lexical/word
recognition, and in production involves lexical selection. Lexical access is
differentiated from word recognition in some models as throwing up a number of
candidates from the mental lexicon from which the final one is identified, i.e.
selected. The mental lexicon is like a dictionary: it stores information about
the pronounciation, spelling, part of speech and points to the meaning of a
word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experiments in word recognition take two main forms: lexical
decision and pronounciation. In lexical decision, subjects are presented with a
string of letters and they have to decide whether this forms a legitimate word
in the English language. This experiment only demands that the subject simply
perform a search through the mental lexicon, without any further processing
required. However, Henderson (1982) has considered that some of the main
experimental findings in lexical decision tasks may be explicable in terms of
processing that occurs after this search through the mental lexicon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In pronounciation tasks, subjects are asked to say out loud
words or non-words, with the pause before speaking being measured. However,
there may be a non-lexical way of saying the words using pronounciation rules,
or by phonological analogy with other similar-looking words (though experiments
with phonological recording address this to an extent). In this case, it may
not be necessary for subjects to access the pronounciation data stored for that
word in the mental lexicon � lexical decision tasks force the subjects to refer
to the mental lexicon in order to identify whether or not the word is a real
one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various experimental findings which any model of
lexical processing needs to account for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>frequency effect</i> � more
common words (measurable for instance in terms of the number of occurrences in
a linguistic corpus) are responded to faster in lexical decision and
pronounciation tasks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>word/non-word effect</i> �
non-words that don�t conform to the rules of English orthography/phonotactics
are rejected very fast. Also, the closer a non-word is to a real word, the
harder it is to reject</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>context effect</i> � if previous
words or a pair of words are related in context, then lexical decision is
faster than if the context is neutral, e.g. �xxxxx butter� as opposed to �bread
butter�. It is not clear exactly though what types of clues context offers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>degradation or stimulus quality
effect</i> � ink blots and anything else that affects the perceptual
information adversely obviously makes lexical processing harder and slower</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>word-superiority effect</i> � it
seems that we are better at recognising a letter as part of a word than on its
own, implying that we don�t just look at the letters and then see which word
they seem to form, but that the emerging list of candidate words affects our
guesses about letters</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Morton�s (1969, 1979) direct access logogen model was
originally designed to explain word recognition of very briefly presented
words, rather than a timed lexical decision task, but has since been extended
with a reasonable degree of success. Visual or auditory input is fed into a set
of feature-detectors. Visual feature-detectors look for lines and curves in
various places, and auditory feature-detectors are looking for the salient
acoustic patterns that distinguish phonemes. Every time a feature is found that
the word being searched contains, the �logogen� for that word registers it in
its variable counter. A word is considered to be �recognised� when the feature
count exceeds its logogen threshold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This direct access model can explain most of the
experimental findings to an encouraging degree, but it does fall over in a few
places. The frequency effect is easily explained by thresholds that are lowered
every time that logogen fires. The context effect can be understood if we allow
contextual information as well as perceptual information to increase the
logogen count. Thus, a contextual feature-detector of some description will
increase the �bread� logogen if �butter� has been detected nearby. Similarly,
the stimulus quality effect can be seen either as a preprocessing perceptual cleanup
that takes longer (Mitchell, 1982), or as part of the feature detection �
either way we would expect the stimulus quality to affect word recognition but
to affect most models in the same way, because they all rely on some degree of
perceptual processing. The word-superiority effect is explicable if we remember
that the feature detectors are looking for features, rather than letters
specifically. Thus the logogen for a word might fire faster and more reliably
than the logogen for a letter because the aggregate features of a word identify
it more certainly than the more limited feature set of a single letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, this basic logogen model does have certain problems
accounting for some experimental findings. Because it explains both context and
frequency effects in a similar way (they are both additive, though one reduces
the threshold and the other adds a contextual bonus on top of the perceptual
feature detector input), we would expect them to show similar patterns of
interaction with stimulus quality. In fact, when Becker and Killion (1977)
tested this prediction, they found that although context and degradation showed
the kind of multiplicative effect expected, the effects of frequency and
degradation added together. Norris (1984) has since found that frequency and
degradation can interact, but that the interaction context and frequency is
larger and more robust than can be explained by the logogen model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, this model cannot account for the experimental
findings with non-words, where we can easily identify non-words that are highly
unlike common words, primed words or any words in the English language.
Coltheart et al. (1977) posited a deadline of some sort, so that if the logogen
doesn�t fire in time, it assumes that it is being presented with a non-word.
But, some non-words are confusingly like real words, and take much longer to
discriminate, so Coltheart suggests that unless the feature detectors are
detecting at a certain rate, the deadline expires sooner. Forster prefers an
account which involves multiple logogens. This is perhaps the most satisfactory
account, because there is some scope for incorporating information about
patterns that extend across multiple letters, as our lexical processing system
surely must in order to identify words that are orthographically legitimate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The major alternative to the direct access model can be
characterised best by Forster�s (1979) search model. Importantly, this model
does not require us to search through our entire mental lexicon, but only
through one of three access files. There is one access file for written (visual
feature detectors), one for spoken (auditory feature detectors) and one for
producing words (containing the syntactic/semantic properties necessary to
decide which words could come next). The contents of these access files are
ordered by frequency, so that the words at the top of the access files are
searched first, with this order presumably changing as a result of which words
have been accessed most recently. This account is intended to be more
parsimonious than the direct access model, which requires a search through the
entire mental lexicon, because the access files are further divided into bins,
which might be divided up by letter or sound � only for non-words does the
system have to search through all the bins. When a word has been recognised in
the access file, a reference is made to the master file, i.e. the mental
lexicon, where the information is duplicated and expanded, including a sort of
thesaurus of related words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The frequency effect is easily enough explained because the
access files are ordered with the most frequently occurring words at the top.
However, given the further suborganisation of the bins, there would need to be
a parallel search in order for the most frequent words to be consistently found
quickest. Context effects are perhaps least well accounted for by the search
model � unlike the direct access model, the search model needs to specify what
sort of information is contained in the files and how it should be represented,
and the basic semantic pointers stored in the mental lexicon that Forster
suggests just would not be sufficient. Unless that list was extremely
expansive, the priming effects that we observe for distantly related words
would not occur. More importantly still, context effects extend beyond just
direct semantic similarities, yet such effects would never arise from this
model. The duplication this model requires would defeat the purpose of the
search model by its inefficiency of representation � we would expect that there
is a means of explaining context effects in terms of an ingenious
representation, probably connectionist, rather than having to posit an entirely
new area of the lexicon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn�t all this talk of �searching through the mental lexicon�
a bit of a high-level way of seeing things? Although both the direct access and
search models could be seen as connectionist, they make more sense if we
imagine the search through the mental lexicon as being a serial search through
a list, like a computer file, rather than the distributed representation of the
brain. In the brain, the mental lexicon will be spread over a large mass of
neurons, encoded as the weighted synaptic connections between them. A �search�
through such a massively parallel system will take very little time at all.
Remembering this makes a supposedly more parsimonious system like the search
model less attractive, which only requires us to search restricted areas of the
lexicon, rather than the entire lexicon. In fact, there is a larger point to
note here � a distributed representation is so very unlike the high-level,
symbolic representations that we use when we discuss storage systems and
searches that we find it very hard to imagine how the mental lexicon might
really work. And this greatly affects how we view the models that incorporate
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both models detailed here struggle especially with the
complex context effects that we observe, especially inhibitory context effects.
This seems to me to be as a result of the simplicity of the way that they
account for meaning. Knowing the meaning of a word can be abstractly defined as
being able to use that word in the right place and time � given how complex the
rules determining this are, it seems unlikely that this information could be so
simply encoded in the mental lexicon, and divorced from the other properties of
the word. Given all of the above criticisms, neither the direct access or
search models described here really do justice to the power of our word
recognition ability.</p>
