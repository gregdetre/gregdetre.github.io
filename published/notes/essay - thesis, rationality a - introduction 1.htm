<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is �objectivity�?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thomas Nagel wants to defend reason as providing authority
and a means of persuading others of the relative merits and demerits of our
beliefs, and so to answer the question �How is it that contingent, biological
creatures such as ourselves can have access to such universally valid methods
of objective thought?� He wants to deny the subjectivist who thinks that �the
first person, singular or plural, is hiding at the bottom of everything we say
or think�, or indeed the relativist who wants to deny that there is any
objective reason to prefer some beliefs over others.</p>

<h2>What are �reason� and �rational objectivism�?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reason then, for Nagel, encompasses any means at our
disposal of accessing, recognising and producing knowledge that is objective.
Our aim as thinkers and rational agents is to arrive at principles that are �universal
and exceptionless� � to be able to come up with reasons that apply in all
relevantly similar situations, and to have reasons of similar generality that
tell us when situations are relevantly similar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>fit in quote from tVfN about forming
representations about ourselves within the world, which we then see as itself just
another<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>differentiate between objectivity
and universality<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3>Different forms of rational objectivism</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the strongest objectivism about reason that I am
going to consider. It is the most interesting form because while its acceptance
would valuably shore up the philosophical enterprise epistemologically against
a number of deep skeptical attacks, it still allows for our finitude and fallibility
as reasoners, as it must. There are stronger forms of rational objectivism,
leading all the way up a God-like form of rationality that admits infallible access
to and production of all objective knowledge. There are weaker types that form
a continuum towards a relativist, Darwinist sort of pragmatism, where our most
rational thought processes have evolved (despite perhaps not even being
particularly adaptive) to produce beliefs relativised to our ecological niche
x0,000 years ago.</p>

<h2>Examples and evidence of irrationality</h2>

<h3>Empirical evidence of irrationality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before going any further, I�d like to demolish any
simplistic assertion that we are unequivocally, wholeheartedly rational by
putting forward some of the strongest evidence and examples of human
irrationality. Any theory of rationality must eventually explain these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various anecdotes and experiments from psychology,
especially developmental psychology, that point towards our minds as developing
over time to fit the niche we occupy in the universe. For example, children
insist that a grain of rice weighs nothing, while a bag of rice is heavy. Young
children fail the false belief test, assuming that people know the outcome of
events they did not witness or hear about. Of course, we know that those
children become more rational over time � but it is worth remembering that at
least at an early stage in our lives, humans are manifestly irrational in
almost every domain, reiterating a picture of rationality as graded, at least
to some degree, which I will discuss later with regard to Cherniak and �minimal
rationality�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Pinker puts it, these children �grow into adults who
think that a ball flying out of a spiral tube will continue in a spiral path
and that a string of heads makes a coin more likely to land tails�. The former
mistake is perhaps not so much one of rationality, but of an imperfect model of
the physical world. What is more interesting about this mistake is that when
the same people (including college students) are shown an animation of a ball
flying out of a spiral tube in a spiral trajectory, they burst out laughing.
This illustrates a second important point � even when our intuitions or initial
judgements are wrong, with a little help our errors sometimes become easily
apparent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The issues surrounding probability are more curious still. Tversky
and Kahneman provide plenty of examples of people�s intuitions about
probability leading them systematically astray, e.g.:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo13;tab-stops:list .5in'>Gambling
     and playing the lottery (the �stupidity tax�) - since the house must
     profit, the players, on average, must lose.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo13;tab-stops:list .5in'>People
     are more afraid of flying than driving, even though plane travel is
     statistically far safer. The same misjudged wariness with regard to
     nuclear power vs coal, or pesticide residues and food additives (which
     �pose trivial risks of cancer compared to the thousands of natural
     carcinogens that plants have evolved to deter the bugs that eat them�).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l6 level1 lfo13;tab-stops:list .5in'>Narratising
     some sort of memory into independent events, e.g. coin-tossing</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems that the brain is adopting rules of thumb in place
of theorems, e.g. the more memorable an event, the more likely it is to happen
(plane crashes). Of course, such behaviour can often be understood to some
degree in other ways. Gambling is a thrill, and plane crashes are off-puttingly
horrific. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>People�s
performance at falsifying hypotheses is also mixed. Wason told subjects that a
set of cards had letters on one side and numbers on the other, and asked them
to test the rule �If a card has a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>D</i>
on one side, it has a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>3</i> on the
other�, a simple P-implies-Q statement. The subjects were shown four cards and
were asked which ones they would have to turn over to see if the rule was
true.�<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>������ </span>D<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>��� </span>F<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>���� </span>3<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>���� </span>7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�Most people choose either the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>D</i> card or the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>D</i> card and
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>3</i> card. The correct answer is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>D</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>7</i>. �P implies Q� is false only if P is true and Q is false.� Only
about 5-10% get it right. It�s not because people assume it�s an �iff�
statement, otherwise they�d turn over all the cards. People seem to be
�confirming their prejudices rather than seeking evidence that could falsify
them�. Cosmides has found that rephrasing the experiment with real-world events
helps, e.g. phrasing a logically-identical problem in terms of a bouncer
checking for under-age drinking � but only when the rule is a contract, an
exchange of benefits. She cites this sensitivity as support for Trivers�
prediction that humans, as �the most conspicuous altruists in the animal
kingdom, should have evolved a hypertrophied cheater-detector algorithm�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The discussions about probability and falsifying hypotheses
serve to make two more points. They show that our thought processes seem to be
biased towards having or forming beliefs and habits of thought that are useful,
efficient, approximate the truth and are perhaps specialised for the world in
which we evolved. Lastly, we sometimes seem able to employ higher-order
processes (involving language, abstraction/formalisation and step-by-step
breakdowns) to validate and quantify these semi-intuitive conclusions and form
the sort of objective frameworks that exemplify Nagel�s conception of rationality.
Indeed, this is how we are able to step back and devise the mathematics of
probability or mechanics to see our error.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, the fact remains that there are discrepancies
between the way we naturally think and the careful, academic, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>rational</i> (e.g. mathematical) way. I will
argue that these discrepancies result from having evolved parochial inference
mechanisms which exploit long-term regularities in our world, since real
science and a generalised rational approach are expensive and slow, and because
evolution shapes specifically for fitness rather than truth. The questions that
remain to answer are whether our inferential mechanisms are sufficiently
powerful in their generalising to qualify as rational, and if so, to what
extent this is explicable in terms of a naturalistic picture.</p>

<h3>Non-empirical concerns undermining of rationality</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I now want to move away briefly from empirical issues for rational
objectivism to a few more general concerns about the limitations of our rational
capacity that a theory of rationality would have to incorporate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:red'>phenomenal character of rationality<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Firstly, we continually find that some concepts, arguments
or ideas are more complicated, remote or difficult to grasp, follow or apply than
others. I am not referring to the trivial fact that we have imperfect senses and
finite, fading long-term memory. I am not really referring either to differences
in deeper cognitive capacities, such as limitations on the complexity of syntax
we can parse, levels of articulacy, varying success with arithmetic or abilility
to imagine a scene. Rather, I am talking about fundamental restrictions and variations
between how easy thoughts are to conceptualise, convey or fully absorb, or
certain processes to follow and criticise. What we can conceive is bounded. This
is so obvious to us that we scarcely consider its significance. Similarly, it
is trivial to point out that different people�s abilities in these areas vary,
and even a single person�s faculties wax and wane with diet, hours of sunshine
in the day or stress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is an ineliminable aspect of our description of an
omniscient being that it would find all such conceptual hurdles to be
inconsequential. We cannot usefully speculate over whether such an infinite mind
would consider all problems and concepts equally trivial, or whether it would
recognise some to be harder than others but still confidently within its
ability. Either way, the fact that we falter, and sometimes fail entirely, to
understand new things is clear evidence that our rationality is bounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Furthermore, our bounded rationality is evidenced every time
two intelligent, humble and well-meaning, sane and highly rational experts seeking
a resolution on their topic meet to debate, and disagree. Sometimes, one
convinces the other. Perhaps they will realise that they agree after all, and
their disagreement was based on a minor definitional point. Often, especially
in science, there simply isn�t enough data available to incontrovertibly confirm
their respective hunches. Occasionally, they agree to disagree because the
resolution comes down to an article of pre-rational faith, such as religious
beliefs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The charitable assumption implicit in these explanations of
why the experts� (who will label philosophers, since they make excellent case
studies here) views are so often irreconcilable is that they simply have
different �epistemic profiles�. This is a handily vague term that stretches
over our entire framework of beliefs and desires, and masks a multitude of
sins. It is intended to describe the ease or degree to which one accepts things
as justified, or the nature of justification one demands. Different people might
be more or less predisposed to employ formal logic, mathematics, a reasoned argument
or speech, intuitions etc. as a means of justification. When our two philosophers
continue to disagree then, it is because the sorts of justification they look
for are different. One might regard the syllogism as mightier than the
scientist, or have a penchant for the slightly mystical (e.g. panpsychism, belief
in God). It might be that their inability to agree on the issue at hand rests
on a long-forgotten willingness in their undergraduate days to adopt certain invisible
background premises which have come to seem self-evident. One might point to
the very small proportion of professional philosophers whose views have changed
substantially in print over the course of their careers as evidence of this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it evidence of a fundamental human non-rationality that intelligent,
truth-seeking philosophers have differing epistemic profiles?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>EP = what they require in order to feel certain about
something, what they prioritise, favoured methods, indoctrination, pre-rational
faith (e.g. religion)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one can still be rational within one�s epistemic profile �
and indeed, especially if we accept Nozick�s optimism about reason�s capacity
for self-analysis and �repair, then we can examine and adjust our epistemic
profile</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what if it�s not just their epistemic profiles, but that
they�re actually just making mistakes/fallacies in their reasoning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ascribing their discrepancy of opinion to epistemic profiles
is more charitable, and leaves more room for rationality than does the
alternative � we constantly, unwillingly and unwittingly err in our reasoning. We
pick these errors up regularly, or others do for us, but it seems quite
possible that however powerful in some ways our reasoning capacity is, these
are symptoms of what is at heart a jury-rigged composite of souped-up
survival-enhancing behaviour modules. These fallacies take the form of mis-applications
of definitions, erroneous steps in an argument etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand how these arise, account for them and
discern whether they threaten our entire claim to rationality, a theory of
rationality may need to delve deep into the sub-cognitive, even low-level
neural implementation of our thought processes. Later, I will try to consider
whether what we do know about the brain is compatible with Nagel�s conception
of rationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Altogether, these obstacles to clear thought lead me to an
unshakeable wariness about our level of rationality in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, all of this discussion is particularly subject to
Nagel�s argument against any attempt to subjectivise reason that such attempts
are inherently self-defeating. I will address this later.</p>

<h2>Rational objectivism vs naturalism as motivating faiths</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems clear to me that Nagel�s priority and motivation
for holding his position is his faith in a reason that can help us apprehend
the objective (and keenness to justify that faith);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mention epistemic profiles</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>mention Nagel�s (good) reasons for wanting
to preserve faith in reason?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the other hand, my own corresponding prejudicial,
prerational or intuitive faith (that I would like to feel justified in having)
is in a scientific understanding of the workings and origin of humanity. At the
same time, we would both like to be able to incorporate the opposing position, which
is problematic for our starting tenet but which we consider to be otherwise desirable
and fairly plausible. In Nagel�s case, he would like to try to reconcile naturalism
(e.g. an expanded Darwinism) with his objectivism about reason. In my case, I
would like to try to reconcile a similar sort of rational objectivism with my
naturalist tendencies. <span style='color:red'>Explain briefly why naturalism
and rational objectivism are difficult to bring together.</span> However, if
Darwinism can�t be expanded to show how humans have evolved to be rational,
then Nagel is content to say that the burden of proof lies with the Darwinists,
and until then we should consider it a handy but provisional and incomplete representation
of the universe that we may never fully perfect. And I want to say that if the
rational objectivist cannot show how such an objectivity-tracking cognitive
capacity could have evolved, then we simply cannot be (and we are not) rational
in the way that Nagel argues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, I don�t think that Nagel would appreciate having
his rational objectivism branded a prerational faith, and I don�t think I�m
being fair to myself either. This way of putting things is mainly intended to emphasise
that epistemological discussions are so crucial, and so entanglingly difficult,
that it seems to me that much of the fervour with which objectivist and
subjectivist positions are defended is testament to philosophers� own
predilections and epistemic constitutions more than anything else.</p>

<h2>What do I mean by �naturalistic account�?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have deliberately couched the naturalistic account given above
in terms of a late twentieth century understanding of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>homo sapiens</i> and the universe. Such a world-view is defined by its neo-Darwinist
account of our origins, and its aim of a complete picture of the workings of
our mind in terms of cognitive psychology, ultimately fully translatable into
(and reducible to) brain states. Of course, the picture available at the end of
the twentieth century is not adequate to explain any high-level cognitive
processes in psychological, let alone neurophysiological, terms. However, such
problems as understanding in physical terms how we learn or use language or do
simple arithmetic are �easy� cognitive problems (and form an inherent part of any
naturalistic account) relative to what might be termed �hard problem of rationality�
of understanding how our thought processes map onto an objective framework. The
problem is �hard� because even investigating it requires one to have already
solved it. It is this hard problem which does not sit well with naturalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is simply the problem of objective knowledge -
�Objectivity itself leads to the recognition that its own capacities are
probably limited, since in us it is a human faculty and we are conspicuously
finite beings. The radical form of this recognition is philosophical
skepticism, in which the objective standpoint undermines itself by the same procedures
it uses to call into question the preflective standpoint of ordinary life in
perception, desire and action. Skepticism is radical doubt about the
possibility of reaching any kind of knowledge, freedom or ethical truth, given
our containment in the world and the impossibility of creating ourselves from
scratch.� �In general, I believe that skepticism is revealing and not
refutable, but that it does not vitiate the pursuit of objectivity.� (tVfN)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not going to define the naturalistic account in terms
of the contents of twentieth century journals, because it is clear that such a
characterisation is more handicapping, restrictive, parochial and defeasible
than the naturalistic account needs to be. Even so, late twentieth century
science is the most attractive naturalistic account available at the moment, and
it�s convincing enough for it to have become epistemically foundational for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rather, borrowing from Rorty, I would like to define the naturalistic
account in terms of what would be acceptable to an ideal scientific community in
the future. An �ideal scientific community� comprises educated, sophisticated,
intelligent, open-minded but critical scientists, like today�s scientists at
their best, working with the benefit of the progress made during the
intervening years accrued purely through incremental science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem with this way of defining the naturalistic
account is that it rests too heavily on just how distant a future we are
talking about. Words like �accrued� and �incremental� conjure an image of
scientists gathering nut-sized nuggets of data assiduously into ever-growing
piles. The problem I am most concerned about with regard to this image is the
idea that each increment of progress is bite-sized, i.e. supports and builds
upon previous theory linearly. In reality, the march of science proceeds in
fits and starts, although the intervening periods may be stable and
consolidatory. I�m worried that just one or two paradigm shifts in succession (on
the scale of the theories of evolution or relativity, for instance) are enough
to distance earlier and later scientific viewpoints almost unrecognisably. A
sufficiently futuristic naturalistic account may be so different, employ a
barely commensurable vocabulary, and shaped to fit a quite different cultural
context, that it somehow renders the current debate about reason�s objectivity obsolete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to form then a concrete naturalistic opponent for the
rational objectivist, I am going to plump for a naturalistic account defined in
terms of what would be acceptable to an ideal scientific community in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not-so-distant </i>future. This way, if we do
decide in the end that a naturalistic account defined so squarely within a twentieth
century framework is not compatible with reason�s objectivity, and at the same
time have not dislodged the objectivist�s arguments, then we will not simply be
left in an unhelpful, rigid stalemate between rational objectivism on the one
hand, and naturalism on the other. Instead, we can probably say that we over-hamstrung
the naturalist by wedding him to a framework which is highly likely to expand
and flex considerably. The next step would be to try and relax our characterisation
of the naturalistic account (at the expense of vagueness) to see whether it might
be more accommodating to rational objectivism, a task that inevitably benefits from
actual scientific advances to measure itself against. We might hope that we can
even pinpoint which particular areas of a near-future naturalistic account are most
at odds with rational objectivism, and for what reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, I would be happiest if it were possible to find a
means of accommodating the rational objectivist within some turboboosted, but
recognisable, version of the twentieth-century scientific framework.</p>

<h2>How exactly then should we characterise our near-future naturalistic
account?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves the contentious question of how exactly to characterise
the twentieth-century framework. I have tried to choose a minimal set of
principles to embody the late twentieth-century scientific picture, all of
which have a direct bearing on our understanding of the rational process, and which
I consider to be explanatorily and predictively generative and coherent, and
elegant:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>philosophy of mind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>extent to which consciousness plays
a role in reasoning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>neurophysiology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>connectionism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>super-Darwinism</p>

margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>evidence (include here???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such a list of principles is an unavoidably subjective task.
Those who take issue with my choices can see this as another point from which
to rally the naturalist�s cause if necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should also explain why I have so far ignored the
relevance of consciousness to our rational processes. It might seem intuitively
obvious to some that consciousness is intimately related to rationality, while it
might seem intuitively obvious to others that the opposite is true. As I will
outline below, I have deliberately chosen a materialist stance in philosophy of
mind in my naturalistic principles, which allows me to avoid treating
consciousness as a separate phenomenon, but rather assume it to be incorporated
into related discussions of neurophysiology etc. This is partly because I�m
keen to drive as much mystery out of the brain as possible before beginning to
discuss rationality (especially given Nagel�s <span style='color:blue'>stance
towards </span>naturalism, or �scientism� as he derisively terms its extreme
forms), and partly because materialism is an entrenched dogma of (late)
twentieth century (cognitive) science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will come back to discuss each of these principles in more
detail, starting with evolution(???).</p>
