<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Griffin (1984) describes the disdain in which some
scientists hold the attempts of �pre-science�, but he is right to defend the
need to outline in theory the investigations that must happen in practice for
science to progress. Studies of animal consciousness, and consciousness in
general, could still be described as pre-scientific, insofar as there is no established
methodology, a lack of rigidity in defined terms and confusion as to how to
proceed experimentally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Indeed, as Nagel (1974) and others have noted, consciousness
can appear completely inaccessible to the scientific method, since the
phenomenon being studied does not appear to be publicly verifiable, by
definition. Consciousness is privileged, that is, only the subject has
immediate access to it. It is almost as though everyone in the world was given
a little black box, and everyone peeks secretly into their box, but cannot
display the contents to anyone else. We, as scientists, can observe the
reactions on people�s faces as they look in their boxes, and try and observe
some systematic relation between the look on their faces (which we assume can tell
us indirectly about the contents of the box) and some other observable feature,
e.g. hair colour. Of course, the analogy with consciousness breaks down quite
soon. In reality, we are peeking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>out</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'> of our little black boxes � they are our
window to the world, rather than the other way round � consciousness isn�t just
subjective � it is </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subjectivity</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>. Weiskrantz limits his investigations in
consciousness to the reportable � what the subjects says about his experience.
Quizzing our subjects about the contents of their black boxes is probably the
best means of ascertaining their contents. But of course, in the case of animal
consciousness, animals cannot describe their internal states to us with
language. Language is one of the most salient features of human behaviour that
evidences mental activity. Indeed, the Turing test is notable as a sufficient
test for human-level mentality. We are severely constrained in our experiments
that we cannot simply ask a monkey whether he feels anything, or what he feels.
Lastly, Dennett (1991) gives various examples of how what we are aware of, or
at least remember being aware of, may be different to what we ultimately
report, e.g. the phi phenomenon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems that ethologists want to hold a series of implicit
ideals about consciousness:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the Darwinian framework will not
require substantial revision in order to incorporate the evolution of
consciousness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the mechanism of consciousness is
explicable at a biological level</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>consciousness plays a causal role,
i.e. is not a casually inert epiphenomenon</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the function it performs is
adaptive, rather than simply being a side-effect or accident of evolution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>this function gives rise to more
intelligent, considered, premeditated behaviour in some way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the level of consciousness is an
involuntary mechanism, almost like breathing, which seems to fluctuate
according to the nature of the task in hand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>consciousness is a binary
phenomenon, i.e. it does not admit degrees</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think we can challenge most of these assumptions. The
first is perhaps the most stable. Dawkins offers a choice between assuming that
natural selection and evolutionary theory can explain the origin of
consciousness, or assuming that consciousness is the sole aspect of life that
cannot be explained by or did not arise through this mechanism. She makes the
choice seem like a safe and easy one, but I have separated it into the two
steps above, which makes it a potentially harder one. The first step is the
step that Dawkins thinks she is making: can the fact of consciousness be
accommodated within a Darwinian framework? I think that ultimately it can, but
that it is because it is not a biological phenomenon. This is where the second
step comes in: Dawkins moves immediately to assume that if it can be
accommodated within a Darwinian framework, that it must be a biological
phenomenon, and so admissible to biological methods. Let us digress to consider
the theory of panpsychism briefly. Panpsychism is the doctrine that �all matter
� has a psychical aspect or component� (New Shorter OED). It is analogous to
pantheism or hylozoism, but rather than the �thesis of the pervasiveness of
life in nature, substitutes the pervasiveness of sentience, experience or, in a
broad sense, consciousness� (Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy). If we were
to ask a panpsychist his view, he might concur with the first step and disagree
with the second. That is, he might be happy to say that an explanation of
consciousness will not disrupt evolutionary theory, but that such an
explanation will not be at the biological level, but at the sub-atomic, say. In
this case, we cannot look to physiology to explain how consciousness arises,
since there is mentality in every single particle or piece of matter.
Panpsychism does give rise to some admittedly weird conclusions, like my arm
being conscious distinct from my body, but it serves to demonstrate how
consciousness could be accommodated within evolution and still not be
biological phenomenon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Epiphenomenalism is the doctrine that �consciousness or
mental phenomena [are] by-products of the physical activity of the brain and
nervous system that do not influence behaviour�. That is to say, our
consciousness lets us view the mechanisms of our brain and body, without
influencing the activity of our brain or nervous system in any way. It�s almost
like watching a scene in front of you on live video � the two seem to be
happening at the same time, and you could almost imagine that the events on the
television screen could influence the physical events on the stage, but in
actuality, the video is just a portrayal of what has already happened. Why
couldn�t consciousness be like this? If it were to turn out that our mental
events are causally inert, then it could not perform any function, adaptive or
maladaptive, could not alter behaviour and could not be observed or measured.
However, it would still exist � just because my conscious experience plays no
role in altering my brain state or behaviour does not mean that I do not have
conscious experience. Whether consciousness is an epiphenomenon or not, in
humans and animals, the requirement it places on us to treat conscious beings
with moral consideration remains the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An epiphenomenon can be more widely described as �a
concomitant or by-product of something�. In this way, consciousness could be an
evolutionary epiphenomenon, resulting for example from the increased complexity
of social behaviour that Humphreys (1978) notes, or from the formation of
internal models of other agents� behaviour. However, it might serve no adaptive
function itself. If this were the case, then consciousness might be
evolutionarily quite recent and restricted to a particular set of branches on
the taxonomic tree. Indeed Jaynes (1976) considers the origin of consciousness
to lie in what he terms �the breakdown of the bicameral mind�. He cites
evidence from various historical sources, including the Iliad, to demonstrate
that historical man literally lacked consciousness, behaving and functioning
permanently much as we do when on �auto-pilot� (Baars 1988, Weiskrantz 1995
(the �British Weather Conversation Syndrome�)). In this case, consciousness
plays no adaptive role since it didn�t evolve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The examples of driving a car and playing a solo in a public
concert are often given as extreme levels of unconscious and conscious
behaviour. Often, we can travel many miles down familiar roads or motorways
seemingly without conscious awareness. Of course, this could simply be that the
memories of our awareness while driving have faded almost as quickly as they
are laid down. On the other hand, when nervously playing an instrument in a
concert, all of the deft hand movements that have become second-nature during
practice suffer from the conscious attention that we suddenly pay them. Dawkins
suggests that consciousness may help us with novel situations or where we have
to plan, while we are able to function unconsciously in most other ways. Thus
consciousness seems to attend certain actions, while others (like speech,
learning and reason) seem quite unconscious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, the question of whether non-human animals are
conscious seems to indicate a binary possibility: either humans are the only
remotely conscious form of life, or a few select other animals (higher
primates, for example) are too. However, if we are prepared to think about a
continuum of degrees and qualities of consciousness, then the question becomes
at once easier and harder. It is easier because we can say that humans are the <i>most</i>
conscious animals we know of, and then trace some line of dwindling
consciousness all the way backwards. It is harder because we have to consider
how the nature of consciousness could be any different to our current state. It
requires us to be objective about the core of our subjectivity, and to free
ourselves from the view �through our eyes only�. Greenfield employs a number of
evocative techniques to help a human imagine what an inferior consciousness
like an animal�s might be like. The most obvious ways include recall of one�s
own limited mental state when extremely tired, intoxicated or performing a
routine task. Dreams are another important means. Greenfield believes that
consciousness may be related to macroscopic waves of activity that flood the
brain, reduced in dreams, larger when lucid. Smaller brains, with smaller
waves, might result in a fragmented, more imagistic, less intense conscious
experience perhaps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you ask a philosopher whether animals are conscious, he
may refer you back to the problem of other minds. Put simply, this is the
epistemological question of whether or not, or by what means, we can be sure
that other humans are conscious, as we are. The only fact about consciousness
that we have is that we are ourselves conscious, and we know this as a result
of our privileged access to our own subjective state. Since we cannot apply
this to gain knowledge of others� subjective states, we assume that they have
them as we do, since their behaviour is often so similar to ours. This is known
as the �argument from analogy�. It assumes that other people�s mental states
correspond to their behaviour in the same way that our mental states correspond
to our behaviour � when they wrinkle up their face they feel disgust, when they
scream �Ouch and snatch their hand away they feel pain etc. Put in these terms,
the argument from analogy is largely discredited among philosophers. Its most
obvious problem is that it is a generalisation from just one case, our own.
Instead, philosophers now place more weight on the �other minds as theoretical
entities� solution. Here, the justification is in the form of a <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.5pt'>hypothetic inference: that others have mental
states is hypothesized to account for how they behave. That other people have
minds is the best explanation we have for their behaviour, and so we assume it
to be true. This requires no evidence from one�s own mental states and
behaviour, avoiding the generalisation from one case. However, it does seem
closely wedded to a functionalist view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus it may be that although our immediate response would be
to view consciousness as an on-off sort of property, (either one is conscious
of the world around, or one is a zombie) even a little consideration throws up
strong support of the idea that consciousness waxes and wanes, and even admits
different complexions at different times and between different individuals and
species. Given then that we have as much reason to impute to animals as to
humans a level of consciousness correlate with observed complexity, I see two
main routes that science could take in its attempt to quantify the levels of
consciousness of animals. Both revolve around the �theoretical minds� solution
to the problem of other minds, but in opposite directions. The first involves
classifying behaviour � if an animal is capable of a certain level of complex
behaviour, then we can assume that there must be a mentality of corresponding
complexity. The second assesses the physiology of the mental mechanism itself �
if the architecture and organisation of the brain is of a given complexity,
then we can similarly assume that it gives rise to mentality of corresponding
complexity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So if we are going to be consistent in our appraisals of
agenthood in the world around us, then we must ascribe a level of consciousness
to other animals (including humans) on the basis of their behaviour. We cannot
hope that employing a single, simple test will suffice, but rather we have to
build up a picture of the internal state of the animal or person. As a rough
guide, we might settle on the sort of tests that give results that tally with
the average pet-owner�s view of the world. This is what the argument from
analogy seeks to do, but it looks purely for similarities with us, with human
behaviour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, we may one day have to broaden this approach,
beyond just the similarities the given creature holds to us. We might look for
similarities between creatures we consider to be fairly conscious with other
creatures that are similar to them but relatively dissimilar to us, gradually
building up a picture of the to the sort of behaviours we are looking for in a
conscious animal. In the celebrated case of imagining what it is like to be a
bat, we will necessarily have to consider how having echolocation and sleeping
upside down will affect our mental world. It seems likely that bats won�t
behave in some of the ways humans do, but do exhibit behaviour of a similar
complexity or considered, premeditated nature. This will be difficult and
probably highly speculative, especially at first. But how else would we be able
to interpret dolphin behaviour ias another dolphin would, by analogy with the
way humans appraise each other?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.5pt'>Finally, the Turing
test provides an ideal example of a test for human-level intelligence and
self-awareness, although it rests on full-scale command of syntactic language
and cannot be scaled to make it appreciably easier. However, the basic idea of
an imitation game might lead to a means of classifying levels of complex
behaviour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, the best guide to the consciousness of
another animal may prove more quantitative, be more obvious though harder to
understand. The fact remains that our brains inextricably and powerfully linked
with our mental world, in both causal directions. That is to say, if I damage
or physically affect my brain, my thoughts are altered as a result. We can see
this directly using electrode stimulation during brain operations, where
patients report a huge variety of subjective feelings as a result, ranging from
sensations to episodic memories. In the other direction, we can watch how
different areas of the brain light up systematically on an fMRI scan as the
patient is asked to perform different mental operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our brains are crucially different to other animals. We can
trace a path back to higher primates, through mammals to reptiles, and see how
our brains have developed over evolutionary time. Notably, the evolutionarily
recent furrowed neocortex has grown over the mammalian mid-brain, which in turn
encompasses the reptilian hind-brain. At each stage, the added complexity and
functionality has been adaptive and necessary for the co-ordination of
behaviour of successively larger and more complex organisms. For instance,
Humphreys (amongst many others) sought an explanation of the need for higher
cognitive function in terms of growing complexity of social behaviour. He
showed a strong correlation between proportional size of neocortex and average
size of social group, implying that bigger groups required richer internal
models to deal with the possibilities for deceit, kin recognition, cooperation
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think that a functionalist, epiphenomenalist and
materialist would all broadly concur that the scope, sophistication and
intensity of conscious experience are related in some way to the complexity of
brain state. This is not to say that the relation is systematic, or directly
proportional. We should be able to hone a statistical measure of brain
complexity that we can use as a best-guess indicator of conscious level. It
might incorporate variables such as approximate total number of neurons, connectivity
or total number of synapses, degree of myelination, proportion/width of
neocortex, afferent and efferent neural bandwidth etc. Such a measure would
certainly prove useful as an intermediate guide for animal rights legislators.
It might be interesting to see whether such a measure correlated with the
degree of consciousness people intuitively attribute to a given species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately then, we are already in the position to compile
statistics on animal consciousness, using these sort of techniques. I would be
surprised if such a consciousness �ranking� table contained many surprises,
given that it is simply making explicit the criteria we use all the time
internally. However, the deeper epistemological question remains, in that there
is still no conceivable means of viewing or measuring what it is actually like
for the animal to be the animal.</p>
