<h2><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Review � Brooks,
�Intelligence without representation�<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>�Human level intelligence is too complex and
little understood to be correctly decomposed into the right sub-pieces at the
moment, and that even if knew the sub-pieces we still wouldn�t know the right
interfaces between them.�<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Brooks�
central point is that most of the hard work of intelligence relates to the
business of survival, in being able to do things like perceive, move around and
react rapidly (often in pretty simple, sensible ways). When we look at human
abilities like reasoning, maths or language, there is a temptation to assume
that these can be replicated without the embodied trappings that allow us to
operate in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>However,
the representations and processing which underly these abilities are firmly
rooted in less glamorous tasks, and it�s only by building systems
incrementally, and testing them in the full complexity of the real world that
progress is likely to be made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>�With a simplified world, it is very easy to
accidentally build a submodule of the system which happens to rely on some of
those simplified properties.�<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In
abstracting to some simplified or purified version of a problem, we run the
risk of abstracting away the means of solution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>�There is no clean division between perception
(abstraction) and reasoning in the real world.�<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>This point
is made most forcibly by exposing the (almost certainly wrong) assumption that
the representations we have available to us through introspection are the same
as those which we employ unconsciously on everyday tasks. This is a lesson that
cognitive psychology experiments teach over and over again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Brooks
proposes an alternative architecture, which dispenses with central planning and
representation, and devolves all the perceptual and effector responsibility to
individual layers, each specialised for a particular activity (defined as �a
pattern of interactions with the world�). Because each layer is also
responsible for deciding when to act for itself, the system has a kind of
�Pandemonium� feel. The hope is that such systems are robust (i.e. generally
cope well with surprises), allow for a multiple, complex hierarchy of goals,
and should hopefully be easier for people to understand and manage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The parallels with evolution were instructive � in a sense,
AI researchers and the blind forces of Darwinism are in a similar boat. We have
to make a bit of a trade-off between the massively parallel experimental
resources of mother nature and our human teleological intelligence, but in both
cases, we are seeking to build adaptable, robust systems that occupy a
niche/fulfil a purpose while trying to deal with the inevitable complexity as
best we can. Although this analogy should only be taken so far, the relative
evolutionary timescales are instructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I really enjoyed the paper, and found myself largely
sympathetic to its arguments. However, there are various issues I felt that he
dealt with unsatisfyingly, especially relating to scaling all the way up to
human-level intelligence. He seems to believe that it�s possible, although the
fact that his robots (at the time) involved tiny handfuls of activity layers
(3, 6 and 14) might bely his confidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My concern is that without any self-organisation, the
designers of the system are required to understand and plan each component and
its interfaces by hand, which I don�t think can ever work. I appreciate that
different levels emerge, such that we can ignore the details of a lower level
(like the obstacle-avoidance level) and simply rely on it in the design of our
higher levels (like the wander/explore levels), but I�m not sure that this is
entirely desirable for at least one good reason. One of the benefits of a
connectionist system is that its own processing is entirely open/transparent to
other components in the system. This can be a disadvantage, but it does make it
much easier to build multiple (subtly different) representations for different
purposes, e.g. in the visual system. By employing a design paradigm that sets
the componentry and interfaces in stone, I don�t see how such systems could be
adaptive or learn, and I don�t think human designers would be able to manage
interfacing of human-level complexity. From what I understand of current
projects, Brooks is employing connectionist components where they�re most
appropriate, but I don�t know to what extent the system architecture as a whole
is able to flex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>There is
one further fact to note: we do clearly have neural representations, whether
topographic or more abstract, scattered throughout the brain. I think that
Brooks might be able to argue that these aren�t representations so much as
isomorphisms. By this I mean that isomorphisms between various modules�
internal structure and the domain of their activity might arise as artifacts of
their particular learning algorithm (e.g. topographic representations might
emerge simply as the state which minimises mean wiring length). In contrast, a
representation is something manipulable, a predictive internal model of the
world on which the function from inputs to outputs is based. Brooks discusses
the contrast between the interpretable structure of layers and (implicit)
representations along different lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>�We believe
representations are not necessary and appear only in the eye or mind of the
observer.�</span></i><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Having said
this, I think it would take considerable work to flesh out Brooks� ideas to
account for how intelligent systems can consider counterfactuals and future
possibilities in the absence of some immediate feedback loop with the world.
I�m sure it could be done, but perhaps only at the expense of most of the
cleanness and revolutionary-seeming force of his argument. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Review � Cantwell Smith,
�Origin of objects�, ch 6, �Flex and slop�<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smith is trying to outline a metaphysics which doesn�t
assume the subject-object split, but explains it. Since terms like �perception�
and �conception� already carry the assumption of a direct object that is
perceived or conceived, he introduces a new unitary term, �registration�. To
register is to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>�parse, make sense of as, find
there to be, structure, take as being a certain way, carve the world into� </i>(pg
191)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To say that �the sailor in the crow�s nest registered the
island� means that there really is an island, and that the sailor ended up in
an �intentional relationship� to it. He doesn�t unpack the notion of an
�intentional relationship� really until later, but we should understand it as
implying some sort of (asymmetric) engagement between both registrar and that
being registered, and that the content of the registrar�s stare �is the island
itself, not an impression of the island�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then introduces the crucial notions of flex and slop. I�m
still unsure whether he considers them to be two words for the same messiness
and weak inter-connectedness, or whether they have subtly different
connotations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He considers a hypothetical gear world, where every single
cog is in connected to everything else as part of a monolothic machine. If one
cog is twisted, the entire structure moves together in lock-step, though each
cog may move at a different speed. Effects are propagated immediately and
deterministically. Such a world wholly lacks flex and slop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�[Our] world is fundamentally
characterised by an underlying flex or slop � a kind of slack or �play� that
allows some bits to move about or adjust without much influencing, and without
being much influenced by, other bits�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �butterfly effect� is not a counter-example to this
assertion, since for the most part, such minute disturbances don�t amplify in
this way, and even when they do, their effects take time and tend to be
chaotic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given this flexy, sloppy world, we can sharpen what
interests us about causality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�Because of the dissipative
nature of the playing field, an enduring entity cannot, at any given moment, be
affected by things that, at that same moment, are beyond what I will call
effective reach�</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More importantly:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�flex and slop underwrite the
very notion of connection, disconnection and the limits of effective reach �
otherwise, there�d probably be no warrant for saying the world had parts at
all�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as effective reach limits which parts of the
physical world can immediately affect an agent, we can start to talk about
strategies for dealing with those parts of the world which are beyond effective
reach, but still matter because of �past connections, present interests, future
possibilities�. The most basic of these is illustrated by the
�super-sunflower�, which continues to move in the direction of the sun�s trajectory,
even when the sun is occluded, to be ready for it when it pops back out. We can
see that this is a much more valuable skill for a rabbit that has lost track of
a coyote, but makes an educated guess as to where the coyote will reappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�An internal mechanism has to
compensate for what can no longer be relied on to be effectively provided by
the environment�, <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>��this shouldering of
effective responsibility by the s-region, to compensate for the break in
effective coupling � is no less than the origin of reasoning, representation
and syntax�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because intentionality is based on non-effective tracking,
intentionality is not an <i>effective </i>phenomenon, and will not have an <i>effective</i>
explanation. Neither will objects, although Smith withholds complete explanation
of why this must be so until later. He does mention that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�being an object </i>cannot
be a physically effective property<i>, since there is no way in which a
temporally extended object could have a physical effect distinct from that of a
non-temporally-extended instantaneous time-slice of that object�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and also that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�abstraction, essential to
the notion of an object, is like semantic reach in being physically
transcendent�<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He finally considers how we might individuate the subject
and object. By individuate, he means �what allows us to say of one object that
it is one; or two that they are two�. He discusses this in terms of
abstraction, which �requires separation, in order that the s-region not be
buffeted by irrelevant details�, and �[deconvolving] the deixis�, which is the
means by which the self gathers together as a stable unity as a �long-term
integral or aggregate of <i>that which it must compensate for, in order to
stabilise the rest of the world�</i>. This is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>�precursor to the later
process of shifting the registration of the object from egocentric to
allocentric coordinates. This helps it to begin the long and tough process of
triangulating on the object, and washing out the contribution of everything
else�.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
