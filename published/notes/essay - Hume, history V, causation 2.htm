<p class=MsoNormal>Hume found his own sceptical claims to be distasteful, yet
could find no means to refute them. Likewise, we feel sure that somehow every
philosopher in the last 250 years has missed a crucial and obvious rebuttal to
Hume�s attack on the notion of causation � but what? Essentially, Hume is
asking whether there is anything more to A�s causing B than B�s regularly
following A, and concludes that there cannot be any such thing that we can
know, thus relegating our causal laws to the status of laws of regularity, or
�constant conjunction�.<span style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand the importance of causation is in
Hume�s system, it is necessary to first examine his theory of mind. Hume outlines
a bipartite picture of knowledge based on his identification of seven different
kinds of philosophical relations: resemblance; identity; relations of time and
place; proportion in quantity or number; degrees in any quality; contrariety;
and causation. Resemblance, proportion, degrees and contrariety are all
relations of ideas, which reason employs in <i>a priori</i> knowledge.
Identity, relations of time and place (or �contiguity�) and causation are
derived from experience-based impressions from the senses of contingent (i.e.
non-demonstrative) matters of fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowledge of matters of fact can be seen to be based almost
entirely on causation, and so on an assumption of the uniformity of nature.
Whenever we explain, predict or attempt to understand events, it is on the
basis that the universe is and will continue to operate as it has, though our
knowlede of it might be limited, and that this operation is best understood in
terms of causal laws. This seems undeniable; Hume can point to any number of
instances where we explain events in causal terms, in terms of our expectation
that one type of thing will give rise to another unfailingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left'>A causal law is actually
far more complicated a concept than it seems. At the fundamental level,
causation comes down to �if event C, then event E� (and also, �if E, then C
must have been�). We might then develop this simple principle into a more
general law complete with caveats and exceptions. For instance, we know that a
free-falling object will not slow or change direction unless contacted by
another object. Given enough observations, we can flesh this knowledge out
further into a mathematical model, ultimately without any exceptions, and we
can see science as humanity�s most rigorous attempt at systematising these
regularities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But what, then, allows us to make the initial �if C then E�
causal inference? Hume points to three criteria by which we can compare the
causal with the non-causal: priority, contiguity and constant conjunction. By
�priority�, he means that the cause precedes the effect, rather than being
co-temporal or afterwards. This would seem to be a fair assumption, though past
scientific theories of the ether, action at a distance and gravity, and now
quantum mechanics, have given philosophers reason to pause over this.
Contiguity simply refers to nearness in time and space, which usually holds for
causal events. Hume allows for events which are temporally or spatially
distant, by assuming that there is a chain of unobserved intermediary events
which are contiguous to themselves. Indeed, Mackie is exceedinly cautious in
his discussion of both these points, and praises Hume for hesitating to grant
contiguity and priority the same importance in our notion of causation as he
gives necessary connection, since he thinks that their inseparability from
causation is debatable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This brings us to his final aspect of causation, constant
conjunction. By this, he means that every time the cause is observed, the
effect has been observed to follow, or that every time the effect has been
observed, the cause had also been present, with no exceptions (otherwise, we
employ the principle of induction to look for a larger-scale regularity that
would incorporate all exceptions, such as eclipses within Newtonian mechanics).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hume is moving towards an account of causation which derives
its force from the psychological, rather than the objective or physical. It is
�custom�, or �habit�, that leads us to expect that B will follow an observation
of A. This custom, this inductive faculty, is clearly present in many animals
and babies, so it cannot be a rational faculty. Moreover, we cannot say <i>a
priori</i> that there is any necessity that B should follow A � our certainty
grows with every occurrence, but it never reaches absolute certainty. These
truths are not demonstrative, since their denial does not lead us to
contradiction. If the proposition that the sun will not rise tomorrow were to
prove true, it would be a great surprise, but it would not be contradictory in
the same way that saying �2 + 2 = 5� must be a contradiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet constant conjunction alone seems insufficient to us as a
description of causation. This is where Hume�s theory of the mind plays a role.
He describes ideas as faint, remembered or imagined versions of impressions,
the original sense data. Ideas are given force by custom, so that our beliefs
are simply stronger versions of propositions that we do not believe. The sense
of causation that we see in and ascribe to the world around us derives from
this expectation engendered by custom, based on constant conjunction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If Hume rejects constant conjunction as well as insufficient
to justify our idea of causation <i>a priori</i> then what, in his view, would
constitute such a justification of causation? Causation, as distinct from
regularity, depends on <i>necessary</i> conjunction. By this, he means that
event A and event B have always occurred together when observed, and moreover,
that there is something characteristic and defining about A such that it <i>must</i>
give rise to B. The link between them is necessary, rather than merely
contingently constant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This statement is clear enough in its intent, but we need to
try and be clear about what it might really mean. Talking in terms of
�necessary connection� is certainly making an ontological statement, about
causation as it exists in the objects � there is something about the object or
event that its effect is determined. But <i>what</i> determines that the world
should work in a causal way, i.e. what is it about the world that means that
the future should necessarily follow a path based on the properties on the
objects? And more particularly, what determines that the world should work in
the particular causal way that it does? Hume is unhelpful in response to these
questions, understandably, because he doesn�t believe that we have any
knowledge of necessary connection and so we have no means of conceiving what it
would be like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if we were to have an omni-sensory observer, somewhat
like a human being but with eyes and ears everywhere, existing for the duration
of the universe? If we can imagine that this being could exist from the start
to the finish of time, then we can largely ignore the problem of induction,
since there are no unobserved events. One might argue that there are events
that would have happened if things had been a little different at some earlier
point but did not (�counterfactuals�), and these unobservable unoccurring
events <i>might</i> have differed from our expectations. We will examine later<span
style='color:blue'> </span>whether this concept of events that haven�t or don�t
happen can influence the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to accept a being that lasts for the duration of
the universe, we have to make certain basic assumptions about �time� being
single, linear and finite, in the way that it seems to us. A Kantian might take
issue with this, since it implies an objective temporal property in what they
would regard as the world �in itself�, but it should be possible to re-cast our
thought experiment to please them. If such a being equipped with completely
wide-ranging versions of human senses were to exist, would it be in a better
position to know of causation than a human? At the very least, it would have a
complete empirical record from which it could certainly deduce mathematical
models about the world in the way that science does. In fact, in a
non-counterfactual, i.e. deterministic, world, then any such mathematical
models that fit all the data would be scientific <i>laws</i>. Such a being
would be able to codify this regular world into laws that have operated without
exception on events. They would be able to reduce the informational content in
the world by describing it, in the same way that the formulae for a fractal or
the Fibonacci sequence are reductions of the original data. Eventually, the
world (especially as it seemed to Hume�s 18th century Newtonian understanding)
might be describable in just a few mathematical equations and rules. Such a
being would have completely described constant conjunction and achieved perfect
scientific knowledge. Surely this is an understanding of causation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hume would reiterate that this has in fact failed to show
evidence of causation, i.e. that the events that occurred must necessarily have
been so. We may be able to describe how they are, but without knowing why they
must be so, we are no closer to seeing them as necessarily so conjoined. We
still have no reason to believe on the basis of the regularity we see in our
perceptions of the world that the world really operates on causal laws. What
then would it take to elevate these laws of regularity to the status of causal
laws?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The existence of God might be able to satisfy us. In his
capacity as First Mover and Groundsman of the Universe, he sets out the lines,
limits and laws within which all of the universe operates, and thereby defines
necessity himself. God would be enough then, but only if we accept that his
ability to make causation intrinsically necessary to the world goes beyond any
understanding of the world we have been able to frame so far. But if our only
chance of escape from scepticism lies in our faith in an omnipotent God not to
deceive us pointlessly with his veridical-seeming causal laws, then we are left
in the same tenuous position as Descartes � such a God would solve all our
problems if he did exist, but proving his existence without requiring him to
sanction our proofs seems impossible, and even if he did exist he would need to
explain why there is suffering, vagueness and illusion in our world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But can we be convinced of the causality of the universe
without such a God? Physics and a rich materialist metaphysics together attempt
to provide the same sanction of necessity to the laws of nature that God would,
for example on the basis of the weak anthropic principle. This principle
effectively states that the universe is the way it is because if it wasn�t, we
wouldn�t be here to observe it. If the fundamental constants of the universe
had been any different, life and intelligence as we know it would never have
arisen. Had the weight of the neutron not been marginally greater than the
proton, there would be no consciousness. This principle is intended to explain
how it is that the universe is, coincidentally-seeming, exactly as it needs to
be for us to have come into being. (More recently, even stronger claims that
the universe must necessarily be have been attempted using quantum mechanics.)
But putting aside such ambitious attempts to use mathematics and theoretical
science to explain the universe as a <i>causa sui</i>, it seems inescapable
that any scientific (i.e. empirical) conception of the world is wholly
dependent on the assumption of causation, and so can only provide circular
justifications for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For even the weak anthropic principle seems to be relying on
certain very basic laws about universes coming to exist at all, in certain
ways, with predefined fundamental properties with varying constants. Hegel
provides one of the few examples of philosophers who have believed that the
entire world can be built up from a single foundational point or principle,
even down to the seemingly contingent minutiae of our scientific world view.
Unfortunately, Hegel notoriously proved the motion of the celestial bodies, and
from it that there could be no planet between Mars and Jupiter � ignorant of
the discovery of just such a planet a few months previously. We have already
discussed and dismissed Descartes� theistic attempt along similar lines above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point, we need to observe Galen Strawson�s
distinction between ontological and epistemological claims about the lack of
causation. He asks whether Hume is saying that there really <i>is </i>no such
thing as causation in the world (ontological claim), or whether he is rather
saying that we can never <i>know </i>whether the regularity is causal
(epistemological claim)? Strawson argues quite convincingly that Hume�s
intelligent standpoint in every other respect is to highlight our ignorance
about how things are or must be, rather than to make ontological claims, even
negative ones. On Strawson�s epistemological interpretation of Hume, he would
be happy to admit that there <i>may</i> be scientific laws that are somehow
self-defining and necessarily must exist and be so, in which case we could live
in a universe without a Christian God but with fundamental incontrovertible <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i> laws of nature � but we cannot
ever be sure either through reason or experience that there is causation in the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand how he rounds off this claim that the
idea of a necessary connection in nature cannot derive from either the senses
or reason, we need to further analyse where our notion of causation does come
from. Hume claims that it derives wholly from Custom, that our idea of an
expectation of an effect is strengthened in proportion to the number of
observed instances without exception of the events being conjoined, and that
this process accounts for our notion of causation. Custom has habitually
attuned us to expect that A will follow B, and we have elevated constant
conjunction to a certainty that should really be attainable only with
necessity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But are there any other more plausible accounts of where we
get our idea of causation from? Collingwood in his �Essay on metaphysics�
considers that our notion of causation might be derived from our own
experience. I consider that there are two ways in which our status as agents
acting in the first person could contribute to causation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Firstly and most obviously, our interaction with the
physical world has given rise to our conception of ourselves as agents with
free will, i.e. causal power that we can exert on the physical world. This view
is so deep-rooted that it underpins our systems of morality and legality, and
critically undermines mind-body dualism and various kinds of determinism.
Knowledge about how we interact with the physical world can clearly only be
gained empirically, through this interaction. In this sense then, it cannot be <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>. However, on the other hand,
our awareness of how it feels to exert our will towards an end, such as picking
up a pencil, is not derived empirically. I have specifically chosen the will,
because even our awareness of internal bodily senses, such as hunger or nausea,
are received empirically in the same way that the five �external� senses are.
In the case of the will, we might imagine a person devoid of all five senses,
who could still will certain acts on the basis of desires. Even at this point,
Hume would be able to defend himself, since the causal relationship that we
derive from our will is based on the effects of our will on the world, which
can only be apprehended through the senses. In the case of a man without
external senses, he would never know that moving his arm resulted in a smashed
plate, because he has no sense of touch, hearing or vision. However, if we
allow him internal senses, he might feel nauseous, will himself to vomit, and
feel release in his stomach, and he could derive a cause-effect relationship
from this. Hume can just as easily extend his defence to include all senses,
external and internal (i.e. bodily), since they all provide varieties of
experience, and so cannot be demonstrative. So, Hume is still safe in denying
that any forms of experience can be the origin of our notion of causation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, there is a second means by which we might have
gained our notion of causation as a result of our first person position. As
rational agents, we are wedded to the idea that our mental world is coherent to
some extent. If we take the case of our man without any senses, internal or
external<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
we might imagine that his own rational process might be sufficient to give rise
to the notion of necessary connection. We can certainly see constant
conjunction in the simple habit of counting the natural numbers, where we come
to expect the next number in our head. But for necessary connection, we need to
turn to what Hume terms the �relations of ideas�. Can we not see in mathematics
and logic a kind of atemporal causation. For instance, when faced with the
syllogism:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>������ </span>All men are
mortal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:2.0pt'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>������ </span>Socrates
is a man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span
style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>\</span></span>
Socrates is mortal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our mind steps through the propositions in sequence, with
the conclusion necessarily resulting from the premises. Can we not see the same
sort of progression here as in �cause and effect�. In a simpler case, of �2 + 2
= 4�, don�t we find that �2 + 2� and �4� have always �occurred together when
observed, and moreover, there is something characteristic about A such that it
must give rise to B� (Here, even the Kantian would at least agree that the
process is <i>a priori</i>). As for contiguity and priority, we might attempt
to argue that these are in some way present, in �2� and �4� being near each
other, and that our premises always precede our conclusion, but I think this
might be stretching the argument too far. Rather, we can simply refer back to
our earlier agreement that they are less critical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Such an explanation would turn Hume�s discussion on its
head, since it would allow an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i>
origin for the notion of causation. However, certain rather glaring problems
with this account should be noted. It is highly debatable whether such a wholly
insensible human being could ever attain rationality in the way described.
After all, without senses of any kind, we are effectively deprived of the
notion of an external world, except as that from which our thoughts bubble up.
More seriously still, we have to question whether our thought experiment is
ill-posed in conceiving an insensible man who is able to reason about his own
ratiocination<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>, that is,
perform second-order reasoning. This would almost certainly seem to require
some sort of linguistic approach, which the man would have to have devised
entirely himself inside himself. At this point Wittgenstein�s private language
argument probably throws up more problems than we can possibly address,
especially given the extremely high level of rationality being required of our
insensible man in order for him to derive the notion of causation from his own
ratiocination. Wittgenstein argues that, tempting though it may be to try and
learn about the nature of (our) psychological phenomena by introspection
(turning our attention inwards), it is fruitless. Introspection is not a means
to a definition of sensations, without which such a private language cannot
exist. Without any public behaviour to attach linguistic behaviour to, our
insensible man would remain inchoate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So if we are to deny our insensible man the language he
needs for his high-order speculations, can we salvage anything from this idea
that ratiocination is the basis of our notion of causation? Perhaps, if we
assume that he is as intelligent as we are, but simply in a non-linguistic way.
Could he not have non-consciously abstracted from the structured, sequential,
necessary nature of his ratiocination, in the same way that Custom works on
experience without us rationally bidding it. Is it any different to talk of
Custom as applied internally to reason rather than to our experience? We cannot
afford to doubt that our reason will continue to be structured and necessarily
correct in the future, as we can doubt experience in the future, since to doubt
reason is admit complete scepticism. If we allow the Evil Demon the power to
subvert our reason at every level, the philosophical enterprise is utterly
doomed. If we are prepared to rely on rigorous reason, as we must, then the
problem of induction can be safely ignored when talking about Custom and reason.
We trust that the nature of our rational process will still be structured,
sequential and necessary in the future, else we can trust nothing. In this
case, only a complete sceptic would doubt that our notion of causation could be
derived from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a priori</i> necessary
connections, viz ratiocination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is perhaps one last doubt that ought to be addressed.
What about the so-called �anomalousness of the mental�, as Davidson describes
what he sees as the lack of deterministic causal laws operating in the mind.
Certainly we find it difficult to follow a single train of thought, and we
really have no control over what thoughts will well up next. I think that this
anomalousness can be re-characterised for our purposes in terms of volition �
the difference between my seeing the room shaking during an earthquake and my
flicking my eyes up and down rapidly is that the latter results from a willed
action. Our thoughts are anomalous insofar as we don�t directly will them in
advance to appear � the other way round, in fact. It is the same with
experience: we don�t will the chair to be placed in the middle of the room �
rather, the impression of the chair impinges upon us, yet we don�t describe the
outside world as anomalous � quite the opposite, in fact. Though somewhat of a
departure from the spirit of Hume�s theory of mind, the apparent anomalousness
of the mental should be seen just like experience, as events in our minds that
we can try and process. Rationality is the faculty of judging rationality in
our thoughts, rather than producing rational thoughts themselves. If we allow
ourselves �reason� in this sense, then we are allowing ourselves the faculty
perceive indubitable order in the mental anomalousness, just as we can perceive
order in the physical world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the very least then, we have convinced ourselves that
there are cases of rationally necessary causation � and such cases, though
mental, must be considered as �in the world�, since even thoughts must �exist�
in some sense. We are making an ontological claim about necessary connection in
the world, about events that are necessary in the only way we can understand
necessity, that is, reason. Yet this does not really help us make the claim we
want to make, about causation in the empirical world of objects and colours and
tables. We still have no reason to believe that our claim about necessary
connection between rational propositions extends to rationality in the world.
One might say that it is a smaller claim to make, to say that on this basis it
seems <i>likely</i> that the world will also be rational, but this would not be
a leap of certainty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps though, we should re-consider what we mean by our
having a �causal role� in the world. Certainly, we can view ourselves and each
other as objects, whose effects on the world can be regularised within the
physical laws. But what we really mean when we talk about ourselves as causal
�agents� is that although we chose to do one thing, we might just as well have
done another. Our status as agents is bound up with free will. So, in the case
of our all-seeing anthropomorphic observer, as long as there are humans in the
world, there are counterfactuals, �what might have been�. In fact, even if
there were no humans in the world, contemporary science would argue that the
decay of a uranium atom, for example, is random, that is to say, stochastic,
and cannot be predicted. In this way, we are very close to the bizarre notion
of an �uncaused event�. In this case, the decay of a uranium atom might emit a
particle at time <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>, or time <i>t<sub>2</sub></i>, with
radically different consequences. And lastly, there is the firmly-established
mathematics of chaos, where miniscule difference in the initial conditions
snowball into large-scale alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the notion of counter-factuals cannot be easily dispelled.
This is important, since it forces us to reconsider how weak or strong the
claim of regularity on its own is. The word �regularity� initially connotes a
pattern that our minds project onto events, as though events just happen and we
notice resemblances between them, and then learn to see resemblances and
regularity all around us. And, in a wholly deterministic determined world, this
might be all that happens. But in a world where where one possibility becomes
reality from amongst a host of equally valid but discarded counterfactual
alternatives, then there must be some means by which the universe decides what
will happen in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the worst case scenarios is set out in the New Riddle
of Induction. It would not be inconsistent with Hume�s scepticism about
induction and causation for all our scientific conclusions to be exposed as
holding true until time <i>t</i>, at which point gravity will invert and the
speed of light will halve. Less likely still, the universe might operate on a
random or semi-random basis, and at any point the regularities we have so
carefully codified over time will all be shown to be illusions, collapsed by
some wholly inexplicable exception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way, this is the fear that quantum mechanics engenders.
Its low-level indeterminacy threatens to demote the scientific notion of
causality to mere probability. We seem to be faced with a situation like the
above, where atoms� states could be genuinely unpredictable and our macroscopic
notion of causation would have to be expressed in terms of likelihood. If the
universe were simply navigating its way simultaneously through a host of �many
worlds�, each the reification of a quantum possibility, then the idea of
necessary connection would be being undermined ontologically as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think this fear will probably prove ungrounded. We have to
consider where the indeterminacy lies in quantum mechanics: currently, there is
a rift between our understanding of the classical and quantum levels of
observation. Yet both are effectively deterministic, through relativity and
Schr�ger�s equation respectively. The real indeterminacy lies in our
measurement, and may prove to be only epistemological.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But given that we are so loth to abandon our faith in
reason, that 2 + 2 = 4 will continue to be so in any counterfactual universe or
under any future laws, we have the germ of an Archimedean point of certainty.
On this basis, it seems much more plausible that there is a rhyme and reason by
which the universe determines what state will result from its current state.
Perhaps it operates according to some sort of algorithm, to which our physical
laws are increasingly accurate approximations. Certainly, this optimism drives
physicists. It is also possible, of course, that the universe obeys rules, but
that we can never truly know them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hume might rejoin that we are missing the point of his
scepticism, with our talk of causal algorithms and the like. Even if the
universe were to obey some sort of algorithm for determining outcomes from its
present state, that would simply be a regularity-generating algorithm. Without
there being something about the state of the universe such that it must give
rise to one and only one future, we cannot talk of necessary connection and
causation. According to Hume, an algorithm of the universe that contingently
specifies connections, even universally regular connections, is insufficient
for our notion of causation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But isn�t what Hume is actually asking for incoherent? He is
requiring that there is some �power� inherent in objects such that their effect
is an �infallible consequence�. But this only begs the question, �But how could
a power be a necessary cause of its effect by virtue of itself alone?�, that
is, how could some property be a cause, <i>except within a system</i>?
Properties alone are meaningless. To talk of �mass� as a fundamental property
of the universe says nothing until we talk about the rules which operate on
mass. Hume cannot legitimately talk about some �power� inherent in an object
without there being laws by which that power is governed. As discussed above,
even God the First Mover would need to specify laws for there to be necessary
connection � it is simply inconceivable to human reason that there could be
properties in objects that give rise to effects without laws specifying why
that should be so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reason remains the only case where we can see that something
should necessarily be so, without being able to specify why. If we try and talk
in terms of analyticity, say, it is clear that our rational capacity far
exceeds semantic reduction alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What Hume is really requiring for necessary connection is
far more difficult than first appears. In order for there to be this power that
gives rise to necessary connection, there must be a set of rules that are
themselves necessarily so, which determine that the power has this effect. But
then we are simply moving the burden of necessity to the rules, since any rules
that are not themselves necessarily so are simply rules of regularity. But what
might generate and rule these causal rules if not the universe�s causal rules
themselves? At this point, we seem to be trapped in an infinite regress, which
either demonstrates that Hume�s requirement for necessary connection is
incoherent, or so unfulfillable as to lead us with certainty to an ontological
claim about a-causality in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This entire essay, I have tried to show that faith in reason
would seem to undermine Hume�s conclusions. But unfortunately, I think that
where Hume does err, it is by placing <i>too much</i> faith in reason. If we
are prepared to doubt the bedrock rational premise, that shared human reasoning
is objectively verifiable, even amongst ourselves, then any attack on Hume
crumbles. Indeed, philosophy crumbles. Because this would be admitting that the
only standards for judging reasonableness are reason itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can easily then doubt that reason is necessarily
connected � after all, how else could we argue indefinitely over points which
seem so clearly and distinctly so to one of us, yet incontrovertibly
misconceived to the other? There appears to be a systematic 2-way relationship
between our mental states and our brain states, and if, for instance, we are
caused by a knock on the head to conceive a prejudice for a particular notion,
then our reason may be powerlessly and invisibly subverted. But this is an
extreme case � I think reason can be attacked in its every little operation. It
has proved extremely powerful within a closed, highly specified system, like
mathematics or formal logic. But natural language cannot provide such a system,
and we cannot specify experience in any other, more formal way. There is no
algorithmic means for us to conclude whether or not something is right, no
final recourse � in logic, we can use truth tables or the laws of logic that we
have chosen. In science, we can prove a theory by subjecting it to experimental
results. But in philosophy, we can only argue with reason by appealing to
reason. When our thoughts dance in every direction, there is no public way to
agree whether or not they are rational beyond consensus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This may seem a rather nihilistic view of things. But it
needn�t be. Rather, it supports the Humean standpoint. Obviously, Hume�s own
conclusions were set out rationally themselves, but if we cease to discuss the
problem, it goes away. When we stop demanding deductive justification for
induction, we have no reason to doubt induction. Similarly, when we stop
assuming that reason is our supreme mode of comprehension, then a deductive
understanding of causality is revealed as both hopeless and worthless.</p>

experiment, though rather extreme, has some basis in physiology. Loss or lack
of one or more of any of the external senses is common and well-documented,
(blindness, deafness etc.). Loss of them all could conceivably be achievable
with surgery or through some horrendous congenital condition or accident. As
for the internal senses, a rare affliction known as �anasognosia� deprives the
sufferer from any bodily feedback whatsoever. This leads to some extremely
bizarre cases of anasognosics who refuse to recognise extreme bodily
dysfunction, for instance. See Damasio, <i>Descartes� error</i>, 1994.</p>
