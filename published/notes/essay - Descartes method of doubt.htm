<div class=Section1>

<h1 style='margin-bottom:3.0pt'>Is Descartes� project of doubt futile and a
failure?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes� noble, if immodest, quest is founded upon his
�method of doubt�. By first ridding at least the meditative portion of his mind
from all uncertain pre-conceived notions and beliefs, he hoped to build an
epistemological system upon self-evidenced,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>unassailably certain truths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The development of this project of doubting through suspense
of judgement is traceable to earlier works like the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Regulae</i> and<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Discourse on
Method</i>, where he formulates rule-based, prescriptive sets of steps. His
method is intended to be useable by anyone of reasonable intellect, and to
ensure absolute certainty in its conclusions, if absolute certainty is
attainable. Just as the modern scientific method provides empirical verifiability,
Descartes relies on the �natural light� as his criterion of truth. With this as
a standard, it should naturally follow that any adherent to the method of doubt
should draw the same conclusions. This could perhaps act as a means of judging
the success of the method of doubt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are perhaps three main ways in which attacks can be
levelled at the method of doubt in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meditations</i>:
on the concept of a �method of doubt� as being unoriginal and superfluous; on
Descartes� failure to implement it according to his own rules, whether through
possibly subconscious self-delusion or human error; and on flaws in the
metaphysical underpinnings of the method of doubt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hobbes dismisses Descartes� discussion of the dubitability
of sense-perception and wakefulness as �ancient material�, and questions
whether Descartes� attempt is something original worthy of fanfare. Surely,
every system-builder must first establish the fundamental premises which
underpin their conclusions, even if they lack Descartes� explicit<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>guidelines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>What exactly Descartes means by
�doubt� is obviously an important question. The �practical� everyday doubt to
which we are accustomed usually refers to our denial of a belief (�I doubt
that�), or reservation of judgement between two conflicting propositions, often
resolvable by an empirical or other accepted criterion. Moroever, closure is
�contingent on the current state of knoweldge�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, Descartes� metaphysical doubt is a
deliberate with-holding of assent, by power of the will for as long as the
intellect apprehends it without complete clarity and distinctness. After all,
to positively deny an uncertain proposition would be as risky as to affirm it.
As Michael Williams perceives in a contrast with classical Greek scepticism, Cartesian
doubt is stratified, i.e. built up in deepening layers, such as the three
arguments in the First Meditation to doubt the senses (because they sometimes
lead us to erroneous conclusions, the argument from dreaming and the idea of
the malicious demon). Since the available knowledge is not perceived to change,
only to grow layer by layer, doubts replaced by beliefs are not ephemeral, but
final. Having said this, there is a curiously time-indexed way in which beliefs
are held, doubted and then re-affirmed once more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, Cartesian �metaphysical� doubt could be said to be
rather different to �practical doubt�, besides the degree of caution and the
nature of the propositions being doubted.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:3.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many Descartes readers are disappointed when the high ideals
espoused in the First Meditation seem compromised in later, key sections,
notably the proofs of God. It seems suspect that Descartes� explicit aims were
to prove that the framework erected by science is on solid ground, as well as
justifying often-voiced religious beliefs in God and the immortality of the
soul. However, just because these pre-conceptions coincide with his conclusions
does not detract from the value of his work, as long as Descartes� arguments
stand independent of Descartes the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes employs more implicit metaphysical �truths� than
he recognises, besides baldly stating various scholastic maxims integral to the
coherence of his proofs. It is difficult to know whether he is aware of how
often he takes for granted doctrines untested by the method of doubt, such as
the �perfect transparency of mind�, by which he assumes that he is necessarily
aware of his thoughts, and that they are somehow free from the impossibly
subtle tendrils of the malicious demon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, especially in his specious proofs of God, he makes
liberal use of statements such as, �what is done cannot be undone�, �it is
manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as much reality in
the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause� and describing
preservation as equivalent to a continual process of re-creation, both of which
arguably lack sufficient clarity and distinctness to hold up in proofs of God.
In fact, entire swathes of the Third Meditation hinge on suspect definitions
such as �objective� as opposed to �formal� reality, besides the shakiest
premise of all, that of a supreme, perfect (in a very anthropomorphised,
Christian way quite different to the amoral connotations of �infinite�) God who
numbers unity amongst his properties, and so also must exist. Despite having
piously described and ascribed so much to God, Descartes shiftily hides behind
the defence that his nature is ultimately inexplicable to us, whenever faced
with questions such as �Why would God create us?� and �Would he definitely admit
himself to be discoverable?� Moreover, his own religiosity is evident in his
failure to question gaps between the simple ideal world constructed eventually
and our real world � for instance, if our free will has been given us complete
by God, why are we deprived of the will to suicide? After all, why is dying a
bad thing, given how divorced from the body Descartes describes the mind as
being?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other fundamental concepts which need to be taken
on board before the Cogito can be applied, such as what an object is, �truth�
and �certainty�. These are concepts embedded within the method of doubt, and so
not evidently subject to its scrutiny. Descartes himself seems unaware of them
until writing later in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Principles</i>,
where he is forced to admit their pre-supposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>Descartes regards dreams initially as
an insoluble source of confusion to us regarding the external world. Five
Meditations later, he highlights memory and continuity, quite independently of
any extra premises or the existence of God, as being our safeguard against
mistaken wakefulness. There is no explanation why the method of doubt failed to
supply this same answer through the natural light when the question first
arose; instead, dreams are used to lend plausibility and weight to the argument
that we cannot trust our sense perceptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any argument from dreaming will be difficult to settle
confidently because dreams assault the usually sure sanctitude of our mental
life, and only imperfectly admit the scrutiny of our consciousness. Given that
all modes of thought can perhaps be experienced within dreams, including
obviously sense perception and even rational thought (monitored in sleep
laboratories during what are known as �lucid dreams�), there seems to be no
dream test which could conceivably discern our dream state while dreaming - or
awake for that matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, the only recourse seems to be the familiar one,
i.e. that God would not let us be deceived by dreams our entire lives (even
though he does it a little bit occasionally). This is even more unsatisfying
than the parallel authentification of our senses he adduces, especially as it
leaves unanswered why dreams should be considered less �real�, in any sense of
the word, than being awake. In fact, although Descartes is more original than
Hobbes gives him credit for by elevating the dream state from a delusion to
being an experience of sensory perceptions without physical causes, he still
falls short of fairly comparing its �reality� to the wakeful state (which has
breaks and differing levels of consciousness and coherence too).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes sets two circularities spinning in opposite
direction in his argument: on the one hand, a supreme and perfect, inherently
good God acts as guarantor of our knowledge while on the other hand, the supremely
powerful and cunning maliciously subversive demon seeks to lead us astray
wherever possible. Dismissal of the hypothetical demon through God�s existence
rests on a proof of God which could itself be subject to the demon�s influence.
Thus we find ourself in as potentially inextricable a position as with the
argument of dreaming � there seems to be a starting level of doubt and
uncertainty beyone which there is no Archimedean point from which to proceed.
In this way, Descartes may have slipped a spanner into the works of his own
mechanism by introducing the evil demon, who is not not really that different
from the God he goes to such great lengths to prove.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>The method of doubt itself has flaws
independent of the topic being investigated with it. Hume numbers amongst those
who simply believe that Descartes� demands of those (including himself) who
wish to employ the method of doubt are impossible. In fact, it is not clear
whether our will, which he describes as digital, would be capable of with-holding
assent, as opposed to merely opposing or denying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although Descartes� methodology is as precise as he could
make it with regard to the elimination of uncertainty, he becomes almost
platonically mystical in his descriptions (also using the visual metaphor) of
how to judge when a proposition is certain and true. The Cogito is described as
�self-evident�; indeed, Descartes shied away from attempts to formalise it in a
syllogy, stressing the importance of the meditator being able to hold it
conceptually in order to be able to use it to affirm his existence. Does this
mean that only plainly self-evident truths can be intuited? Some sort of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite attempts to make the method of doubt almost
mechanical, an ineliminable element of forward-reasoning remains, requiring
something personal and inexplicable from the meditator in order to progress.
Indeed, the jump from blackness to the Cogito could not have been guided by the
natural light (for Descartes did not identify it until afterwards). Further
intervention is necessary in judging the level of �clarity and distinctness�
sufficient in propositions which are to be held certain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The notorious circularity in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Meditations</i> is also manifest in the problem of selecting �true�
truth criteria. Descartes uses the �clarity and distinction� as shown by the
�natural light� as the criteria for judging the certainty/truth of a
proposition, but he effectively used those same criteria in choosing them as
the criteria. Although he devotes a great deal of space to discussing why we
commit intellectual errors sometimes, while simultaneously refusing to accept
that God could allow us to be deceived, he fails to aid the reader since his
own criteria are neither clear nor distinct themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that Descartes concluded by establishing the truths
he held most dear at the beginning of the Meditations could be a result of the
fact that that was the direction in which the natural light happened to shine
most clearly and distinctly for him; perhaps others, following his procedure
assiduously and being guided only by what seemed wholly clear and distinct to
them, might conceivably be led in different directions. Indeed, this is what
one might expect to happen if there is no absolute universal certainty
attainable in this manner. Some might simply find that no natural light clears
the maelstrom of metaphysical uncertainty. As is obvious from the lack of
universally-accepted progress, this myriad of opinions is in fact what we find
in men who attempt the method of doubt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea of absolute (unimprovable level of) truth or
certainty should itself be considered uncertain. That there is a sole
accessible truth underlies Descartes� entire enterprise. But a problem still
remains in the differentiation between certainty and truth. On the one hand, it
could be said that if one is certain of something, one is by definition certain
that it is true. On the other hand, one can be wholly certain of something
which happens to be untrue. These two irreconcilable relations between
certainty and truth leave Descartes unwittingly in a quagmire with regard to
his immediate aim of being certain of his conclusions, since they may or may
not take him any nearer the truth than opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other technical objections can be raised to the way in which
Descartes treats doubt. The way in which he razes to the ground the edifice of
his knowledge by doubting a few choice principles evidences his view of
knowledge as being built upon foundations. Critics have suggested that it could
as well be a web of inter-connected understanding, where the epistemic weights
is evenly distributed. Alternatively, doubt might not be culminable, i.e.,
although no single proposition is indubitable, there is a maximum proportion of
our pre-conceptions we can doubt, beyond which the doubt becomes meaningless.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:3.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the efforts Descartes makes to detail his procedure
for assenting only to that of which one can be absolutely certain, there still
remain many areas in which a serious reader would claim he has strayed. By the
Sixth Meditation, he has been swept up by his own fervour, to the extent that
even basic empirical falsehoods regarding pain and the nervous system are
admitted with minimul scrutiny. That there is such contention surrounding
almost every point he makes is perhaps the most telling sign that Descartes has
failed to produce a wholly persuasive argument through the method of doubt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question of whether the Cogito is indubitable, and if
so, whether it provides an �Archimidean point� from which Descartes can build a
bridge to God or the external world is too complex to approach here. However,
it certainly seems as though Descartes has found one of the few propositions
which, given �perfect transparency of mind�, could have an element of
indubitability. However, perhaps Descartes� greatest mistake is in failing to
realise that if the evil demon is powerful enough to gnaw at the axioms of
mathematics, then any edifice built in its shadow is suspect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Cogito does bring up a rather modern issue though, which
is the problem of language. The subtleties of expressing, in language, the
logic and limitations of expression in language is enough to send anyone into
swirls of self-doubt. However, these niceties become critical when considering
whether existence is a predicate, or the cogito is a syllogism, for instance.<span
style='color:blue'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The project of doubt in principle would seem to be worth
pursuing, and indeed is often applied under different guises, but Descartes�
use of it in the Meditations seems to fall on so many grounds that he has
failed to produce the single truth that he sought. However, his work is still
invigorating for its confidence in our ability to access truth and its
tantalising progress in one direction out of �the deep whirlpool of
uncertainty�.<span style='font-family:"Venetian301 Dm BT"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
