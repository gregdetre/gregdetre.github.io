<h1>Is there a place for linguistic determinism in the psycholinguistic theory
of Orwell�s 1984?</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>Greg Detre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:2.0pt;text-align:right'>Monday,
09 October, 2000</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pinker�s lengthy quotation from Orwell�s <i>1984</i>
highlights perhaps its most alarming legacy, Newspeak, the barbarised form of English
where every term, idiom and phrase had been robbed of connotations damaging to
the Party�s cause. The premise is that without the means to formulate
antithetical expressions and concepts in words, the populace would be robbed of
the means to even think of such notions, bringing a chilling concreteness to
the idea of linguistic <i>determinism</i>. Such a strong form of linguistic
determinism can be contrasted with strong cognitive determinism, where it is
our cognitive processes which wholly shape our words. Somewhere between the
two, there must be a more plausible way of understanding the interaction
between thought and language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pinker draws attention to the pivotal phrase, �At least so
far as thought is dependent on words�. Orwell is perhaps overstating the case
for Newspeak when he considers that the connotations of intellectual and
political freedom can be eradicated and lost forever from the word, �free�, in
the same way that �queen� and �rook� fail to conjure up checkerboards to
someone who has never played chess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pinker gives various examples of creoles being born adult
from fledgling pidgin dialects in the space of a single generation. This is
strong evidence that human languages grow to full maturity and complexity,
however stunted and restrictive their birth may be. His examples of the
Atlantic slave trade and the South Pacific give strong cause for hope that the
Oxford English Dictionary could not one day stage a totalitarian coup simply by
repressing the means to vocalise rebellion. For after all, though the emergence
of writing was a laborious, multi-step process requiring luck, genius and
circumstance to gestate, spoken language seems to well up irrepressible and
rich wherever humans congregate. Though the extent of universality and
differences between human languages is highly debatable, some genetic
predisposition to learn or form human language seems incontestable. It is also
doubtful whether a language could be constructed (let alone enforced) which
remained functional having had so many integral concepts stripped away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us instead consider the weaker form of linguistic
determinism, usually termed �linguistic relativity� after Benjamin Whorf�s
phrase. We will first understand his use of the term, before discussing
alternative forms which linguistic relativity might take.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whorf was an amateur scholar in a variety of Amerindian
languages, especially Hopi (Arizona), Aztec, Maya and Nahuatl (Aztec). His
ideas originated from his respect for Fabre d�Olivet�s, work which
characterised certain Hebrew letters as having high-level connotations (e.g.
goodness, stability). This led him to posit that the Amerindian languages were
fundamentally different from �Standard Average European� languages. He believed
that the Amerindian languages are �oligosynthetic�, i.e. they are comprised of
just 35 root fundamental element ideas which underly the whole language. With
Sapir�s help, he extended these lexical differences to incorporate grammatical
structure, growing into the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His two major premises were that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>language shapes our higher-level
thought; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>the structure of your first language
influences the way you understand and behave in your environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His contemporaries, Lenneberg and Feuer, sharply criticised
Whorf�s methodology and conclusions on a number of grounds. Lenneberg points to
the translation techniques Whorf used to demonstrate differences in languages,
e.g. just because two languages describe an event very differently does not
mean that they have a different way of seeing that event; it might simply be
because the language has developed metaphorically in one direction (e.g. we are
unaware that �breakfast� comes from literally �breaking a fast�). Lenneberg
also points out the basic requirements of the scientific method dictate neutral
and separate descriptions of the linguistic and non-linguistic events before
attempting to correlate them. Otherwise, the argument for linguistic relativity
is either circular or tautological, if the evidence pointing to the differences
in �world view� on the basis of language structures <i>is</i> the differences
in language structures. Feuer also claims that our perceptions of reality
cannot differ greatly, because a wholly <i>incorrect</i> perception of reality,
i.e. our environment, would not give us much chance at survival. However, this
seems a weak criticism, since many of the differences Whorf points to,
especially some of the subtler praises of Hopi language structure, are not
differences which would affect our survival. They relate to our perception of
the �Cosmos� (to use Whorf�s term), rather than our internal representation of
the immediate environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of Whorf�s ideas hinged around his interpretation of
the Hopi language as having a more precise and less misleading grammar and
terminology than English, and better fitting a modern physicists understanding
of the Cosmos. He gives examples of the Hopi use of a word akin to �slosh�
instead of �wave�, the lack of subject-predicate distinctions and the Hopi
inclusion of both space <i>and </i>time in a sentence. Pinker appears to
demolish Whorf�s examples, notably Whorf�s conjecture that they understand time
in a fundamentally different way because they have no linguistic means of
dividing time into units. This about a culture with advanced calendars, knotted
ropes to represent days passing and other expected chronological paraphernalia
peppering their sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong initial support for some form of linguistic
relativity is suggested by Brown and Lenneberg�s 1954 experiment which showed
that differences in our ability to recognise and remember colours were
associated with availability of specific colour names. If this experiment were
to be accepted, it might demonstrate a weak form of linguistic relativity,
since it directly relates a simple lack of vocabulary with elementary
perception. In the same way, we might not expect a caveman to be able to
remember or distinguish between a truck and a car. Perhaps though, familiarity
and a simple understanding of their separate functions would help, as would
being taught separate words for them. A large vocabulary forces fine
distinctions upon us, but Whorf�s stronger form of linguistic relativity
emphasised grammatical structure, a much finer and potentially more fundamental
influence on cognition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, on closer inspection the experiment�s results imply
somehow that speakers of certain languages are robbed of the biological
capacity to perceive these different colours. It is not made clear how our
knowledge of language could somehow affect the connection<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>between our retina and visual cortex, or
wherever in our brains is affected. It seems inexplicable that such a subtle
physiological change would result from the vocabulary of the language we speak.
This confusion has been cleared by more modern experiments on the eight most
common colour words, whose commonality appears strictly ordered throughout the
world�s languages, suggesting that the likelihood that a language has a word
for a particular colour mirrors the ease with which our eyes appear to be able
to perceive and learn to identify that colour. Although experiments over the
years appear to demonstrate that subjects are better at identifying the colour
of different paint chips from memory if a word in their language approximates
the colour, this makes sense if we imagine that our verbal and visual memory
together are more reliable than one without the other. Hence, having a colour
word would give us a convenient tag for a colour, without necessary precluding
other colours from being perceived any less easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar fashion, Alfred Bloom�s experiment intended to
demonstrate that the the Chinese language�s lack of any basic grammatical
construction mirroring the subjunctive means that the Chinese have great
difficulty understanding counterfactual situations is a straw man. Researchers
have since criticised the experiment on the basis of the standard of the
Chinese in the story he used, and ambiguities in the science mentioned.
Unsurprisingly, the results have been shown to be invalid by more recent
experiments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linguistic relativity takes on many forms. Whorf�s
hypothesis was based on a humanist hope that understanding the barriers
language erects between cultures would allow us to better understand cultural
differences, rather than excuse them. He even had hopes for building a
universal language which transcended the gulfs between people�s perceptions of
reality caused by language structure. It may be that gender biases in words
like �mankind� perpetrate gender biases in attitude, but this is a moot point
irrelevant to the discussion here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity holds
that our conceptual space is mapped, shaped and bounded by our language
structure. Folk psychology points to evidence like the eskimos� fabled twenty
words for snow. Again, Pinker is quick to attack such fallacies with the facts.
However, the point remains that surely the language grew up from the
constraints of that culture�s reality (hence this particular idiosyncracy of
the Eskimo tongue), though each person�s grasp of it will shape their own
thought. As Feuer noted, as we all share fundamentally the same reality, so
should we largely expect our languages to have converged in similar directions.
But, just as an individual person�s personality is shaped by the dimensions and
condition of his/her physical body, while sharing the same DNA and race with
those geographically close, so does our individual grasp of language shape us
even as we share it with others. Language and genes differ across cultures, but
need we expect our different languages to affect our conception of reality any
more than our racially differing genes do? It may be that research to
corroborate or dismiss Luigi Cavalli-Sforza�s claim that our historical
language tree mirrors our gene tree would shed further light here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An alternative theoretical escape from linguistic
determinism lies in the idea of a language of thought, or �mentalese�. It could
be that mentalese is our true mother tongue, but requires translation into
words that can be articulated by our vocal cords. After all, how could we mean
to say something slightly differently to the words we use if language and
thought are inseparable and unmediated? How could we translate from one
language to the other or remember the gist of a text or speech without
remembering it verbatim? The answer lies in our internal representations, which
need not be stored in our spoken language, or even in a mentalese. We know that
at a low level they are stored by long-term potentiation as synaptic weights,
but we don�t know how the brain�s structure aggregates up to a higher level,
i.e. how the neural maps to the conceptual level. (So we could of course say
that, in a sense, the existence of mentalese is a certainty, if we choose to
see the digital firing patterns of our neurons as its vocalisation. Like an
insanely complex series of bushman�s clicks, our brain forms as an aggregate a
silent electrochemical voice box, communicating internally at colossal
bandwidth. However, the term �mentalese� usually refers to a high-level
representation of concepts and propositions which can be translated back and
forth into words.) If some form of mentalese is the way we form words from
thoughts, everyone�s inner speech is phrased in this same invisible, behind-the-scenes
mental language, and attempting translation from it into restrictive Newspeak
will result in a mute but fully-comprehending populace. But not for long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does this leave us with hope that Newspeak, were it to exist
and be imposed upon us, could really quench fires in our minds by starving them
of the lexical oxygen to burn? It does, on the two counts considered above.
Strong linguistic determinism, where the vocabulary (and grammar) we use
determines the paths and boundaries of our thought can be largely discounted. A
weaker form of linguistic determinism, such as Whorf�s linguistic relativity,
suggests that language might be sufficient to colour our picture of the Cosmos,
but insufficient to remove the means to think heretical thoughts. Moreover, it
seems likely that a language as deficient as Newspeak must surely succomb (like
a pidgin to a creole) to untraceable, effervescent neologisms and idioms which
grow to capture the expressive niche of the day. As for mentalese, the evidence
for an accessible, universal, comprehensible high-level encoding of linguistic
concepts is small � it may be that here methodological difficulties bar us from
knowing definitively.</p>
