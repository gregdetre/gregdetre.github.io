<h2>Auditory nerve</h2>

<h3>Aka</h3>

<p><a href="cochlear%20nerve.html">cochlear nerve</a>???</p>

<p>8th cranial nerve???</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p class="first">vibrations of <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> are transformed into electrical
signals in the <a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a></p>


<p>most of the fibers in the <a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a> innervate
<a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a></p>

<p>each <a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a> fiber has a 'characteristic frequency'
(peak of tuning curve)</p>

intensity</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>frequency resolving power</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">= how selective for a given frequency it is</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">measured by a 'quality' factor</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">= the characteristic frequency divided by the bandwidth
of the fiber to tones at an intensity 10 dB above the
best threshold (known as 'Q10')</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">fibres with a high Q10 have good frequency selectivity,
e.g. the cat's greatest Q10s are about 8 at about 10kHz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>during tonal stimulation</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a> fibers fire preferentially during one part
of the cycle of the stimulating waveform if the stimulus
is below 4-5kHz</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">for fibers with characteristic frequencies below 4-5kHz,
clicks preferentially evoke responses at certain intervals
after the stimulus...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>excited by deflection of the basilar membrane in only one
direction</p>

<p>one tone can reduce, or suppress, the response to another
'two-tone suppression', even though single tones are only
<a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">results from the non-linear properties of the basilar
membrane mechanics</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">works for stimuli other than tones too</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">a stimulus can mask another if it produce a greater firing
rate</p>

<h3>From oxford notes</h3>


<p>individual <a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a> fibers respond to a particular
characteristic frequency* of sound, according to their <em>tuning
curve</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">given a maximum firing rate of 500Hz for a <a href="neuron.html">neuron</a>,
afferent fibers can't use a one-to-one code</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the firing pattern response of a brief tone is not
instantaneous, but builds up</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">most sounds that are biologically significant to humans
contain both amplitude-modulate and frequency-modulated
components, so there must be a mechanism to de-modulate
these components to receive the input signal - this
requires information about the average characteristics of
the response and its time structure</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the <em>volley principle</em> (Weaver) - several fibers
<em>phase-locking</em> (preferential firing at a particular point
of the sound wave) at different cycles of a high-frequency
stimulus might work in concert to signal high frequencies</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the <em>place principle</em> - emphasises the importance of orderly
connections between the <a href="auditory%20nerve.html">auditory nerve</a> and the <a href="brain.html">brain</a> as
the basis of our ability to detect a broad range of sound
frequencies, with each nerve fiber identified by the site
(i.e. frequency) it innervates in the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>detecting speech sounds is difficult because the vibrations
of the mouth and tongue are much slower (c. 10Hz) than the
vocal cords, and below the frequency sensitivity of the <a href="ear.html">ear</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">like a frequency analyser, the <a href="auditory%20system.html">auditory system</a> looks for
speech <em>formants</em>, spectral peaks at particular frequencies
that characterise different vowel sounds - these are
represented in specific temporal and spatial patters of
nerve fiber discharges</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">an individual fiber may have spectral compoentns in its
firing pattern at both the frequency of vocal cord
vibration and at the lower modluating frequency imposed on
the speech sounds by the resonances of mouth and tone,
acting like a demodulator in a radio to extract
significant low-frequency information from a high
frequency carrier wave</p>
