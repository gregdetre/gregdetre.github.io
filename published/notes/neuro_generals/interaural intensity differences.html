<h2>Interaural intensity differences</h2>

<p class="first">lateral superior olive</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p><a href="excitatory.html">excitatory</a> and <a href="inhibitory.html">inhibitory</a> interactions between inputs from
the two ears in the intensity pathway of the <a href="brain.html">brain</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">principal relay nucleus of this intensity pathway
pathway are ecited by contralateral stimulation and
inhibited by ipsilateral stimulation of the <a href="ear.html">ear</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">is this the same as the trapezoid body???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">when</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">both ears are stimulated equally, <a href="excitation.html">excitation</a> and
inhibition balance, and there is little response from
the post-synaptic cell</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">when sound amplitude is decreased in one <a href="ear.html">ear</a>, neurons
in the intensity pathway on the same side respond,
since ipsilateral inhibition has been
decreased</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">neurons are arranged according to the specific
interaural intensity difference to which they are most
responsive. At higher levels, the timing and intensity
pathways converge, where there are neurons broadly tuned
in frequency but specific in spatial localization of
sound</p>
</blockquote>




<p>determine direction</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">if the structures separating the two ears shadow the sound
sufficiently</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">or if the distance is large enough for there to be
differential attenuation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">wavelength dependent</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">high frequency sound with shorter wavelengths are
attenuated more and are shadowed more easily by the head</p>
</blockquote>
