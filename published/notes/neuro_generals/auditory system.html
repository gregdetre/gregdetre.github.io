<h2>Auditory system</h2>

<h3>Pathway</h3>

<h3>From prosem - graziano</h3>


<p>the perceptual loudness of a sound only varies approximately
with decibel level</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">120dB pure tone seems much worse than white noise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>pinna = sound funnel</p>

<p>meatus connects it to tympanum</p>

<h3>Oxford notes</h3>

<h4>Central processing</h4>

<p class="first">ohm</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="ear.html">ear</a> and <a href="brain.html">brain</a> use Fourier analysis to deconstruct/simplify
complex waveforms into the sum of many (simpler) individual
sine and cosine waves of appropriate frequencies, phases and
amplitudes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sound</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">produced by vibrations that result in the
alternating compression and rarefaction (increased or
decreased pressure) of the surrounding air</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Speed of sound in air at standard temperature/pressure = ???</p>
</blockquote>






<h3>Peripheral auditory processing</h3>

<p class="first">Primary auditory afferents - Cell bodies in the spiral
<a href="ganglion.html">ganglion</a> and send their central axons to the <a href="pons.html">pons</a> via the
eighth cranial nerve. They fire spontaneously, and increase
their firing in response to a tone. Most are sharply tuned.</p>

<p>Frequency coding - two ways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">place coding - for frequencies above 3000Hz, the frequency
response of an afferent depends on where along the basilar
membrane it is from (tonotopic = frequency-position
mapping)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">temporal coding - for lower frequencies, afferents fire
during a particular phase of the waveform
(phase-locking). within the population, each afferent only
needs to fire occasionally.</p>
</blockquote>




<p>coding</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">frequency - tonotopic population code</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">phase-locking for low frequencies</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">some other coding scheme for high frequencies???</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">intensity - amplitude</p>
</blockquote>





<h3>Misc</h3>

<p class="first">Ohm proposed that the <a href="ear.html">ear</a> performs a type of Fourier
spectral analysis - complex waveforms are simplified into
the sum of many individual sine waves and cosine waves of
appropriate frequencies, phases and amplitudes</p>

<p>three parts to the <a href="ear.html">ear</a> - outer, middle and inner <a href="ear.html">ear</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a> of the inner <a href="ear.html">ear</a> - a spiral bony canal filled with
fluid that contains the sensory transduction apparatus,
the organ of Corti</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">vestibular apparatus of the inner <a href="ear.html">ear</a> - important for
maintaining body posture and integrating head/eye
movements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sound is produced by vibrations - alternating
compressions/rarefaction (increased/decreased pressure) of
surrounding air, which radiates outward from the source as a
pressure wave</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">pitch = frequency (the number of peaks that pass a given
point per unit time)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">middle C = 261Hz, human sensitivity 20-20,000Hz</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">amplitude = a maximum change in air pressure in either
direction = loudness</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">sound pressure level (in decibels) = 20 log10 Pt/Pr (in
newtons, N, per sq metre)</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>where:</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>Pt = test pressure</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>Pr = reference presure (20 microN/m2)</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>this scale was devised by Bell, who found that the
Weber-Fechner law applies to <a href="hearing.html">hearing</a></p>
</center>

<center>
<p>incremental increases in subjective loudness
correspond to equal increments of sound pressure
level (SPL) regardless of the absolute value of the
sound pressure level</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>the <a href="ear.html">ear</a> has a range of about 120dB, which
corresponds to about 6 orders of magnitude of
pressure</p>
