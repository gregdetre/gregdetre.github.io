<h3>Organ of corti</h3>


<h3>Located in</h3>

<p class="first">scala media</p>



<h3>Function</h3>

<p class="first">sensory transduction</p>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p><a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> interact with supporting elements to
convert fluid waves into the bending of the hair bundles and
resultant ion influxes</p>

sounds of particular interest</p>

<p class="quoted">each fiber responds best to a very narrow band of
frequencies, although most fibers are excited to some
extent by a wide range of frequencies.</p>

<h3>From oxford notes</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">rests on the basilar membrane and is also stimulated by
this movement. Thus, the cochlear compartments convert the
differential pressure between the scala vestibuli and
scala tympani into oscillating movements of the basilar
membrane that excite and inhibit the sensory transducing
cells in the organ of Corti.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>bone conduction</em> = when sounds bypass the middle <a href="ear.html">ear</a> to
reach the cochlear directly by vibration of the entire
temporal bone</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but this is inefficient and important only for
audiological diagnosis (Rinne compared <a href="hearing.html">hearing</a>-impaired
patients' ability to detect air- vs bone-conducted
sounds using a tuning fork in contact with the mastoid
process of the temporal bone behind the <a href="ear.html">ear</a>,
highlighting disruption of the air conductive apparatus)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">thus distinguish 2 broad classes of <a href="deafness.html">deafness</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>conductive <a href="deafness.html">deafness</a></em> - caused by damage to the inner <a href="ear.html">ear</a>
(often surgically repairable)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>sensorineural <a href="deafness.html">deafness</a></em> - caused by damage to the
cochlear, the eighth nerve or the central auditory
pathway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the organ of Corti contains the (inner and outer) hair
cells, the sensory <a href="receptor.html">receptor</a> cells of the inner <a href="ear.html">ear</a>, as well
as a variety of supporting cells</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">particular sets of <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> are moved by <a href="motion.html">motion</a>
initiated in a particular portion of the basilar membrane</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">there are three rows of <a href="outer%20hair%20cells.html">outer hair cells</a> and one row of
<a href="inner%20hair%20cells.html">inner hair cells</a> (inner/outer from the modiolous (central
pillar))</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">each hair cell has a bundle of stereocilia on its apical
surface - they are stiff because they are filled with
parallel arrays of cross-bridge <a href="actin.html">actin</a> filaments</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">these stereocilia project into (and are embedded in) the
overlying tectorial membrane - if the tectorial membrane
and the basilar membrane (in which the bodies of the hair
cells rest) move with respect to one another, the
stereocilia will be displaced/bent</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">this causes a change in ionic conductance at the apical
surface of the cell, a <a href="current.html">current</a> flow and voltage change -
<a href="motion.html">motion</a> of the stereocilia hyper/depolarises the cell, by
opening ion <a href="channels.html">channels</a> that produce an inward <a href="current.html">current</a> - thus
the oscillatory movement of the basilar membrane results
in sinusoidal (depolarising-hyperpolarising) potential
changes at the frequency of the sound</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">apparently it's actually sigmoidal</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the hair cell releases chemical transmitter at the basal
end, contacting the peripheral branches of axons of
bipolar neurons whose cell bodies lie in the spiral
<a href="ganglion.html">ganglion</a> and whose central axons constitute the auditory
nerve</p>
</blockquote>




<p>how are different frequencies of sound neurally encoded?
Helmholtz noticed two interesting features:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the basilar membrane has cross striations (like the
strings of a piano)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the basilar membrane varies in width from the base to the
apex of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a> - narrow and stiff near the oval
window and wide and flexible near the apex of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Helmholtz <em>resonance theory</em> - the cross striations resonate
with different frequencies of sounds (like piano strings
which of different length/stiffness)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">von Bekesy tested this and found that each sound does not
lead to the resonance of only one narrow segment of the
basilar membrane, but initates a traveling wave along the
length of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a> that starts at the oval window (like
snapping a rope tied at one end to a post)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">different frequencies of sound produce different
travelling waves with peak amplitudes at different
points along the basilar membrane</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>at low frequences, the peak amplitude of the <a href="motion.html">motion</a> is
near the apex of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a> (in the region of
helicotrema)</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>as the frequency of the stimulus increase, the peak
amplitude of <a href="motion.html">motion</a> occurs closer to the base of the
<a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a></p>
</center>

<center>
<p>higher amplitudes cause the peak vibration to increase
in displacement and a broader region of the membrae to
vibrate</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>the representation of frequencies along the basilar
membrane is logarithmic</p>
</center>

<center>
<p>the <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> situated at the site where the
oscillation is maximal are the most excited (occuring
at the points predicted by Helmholtz's resonance
theory)</p>
</center>

<p>the <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> within the organ of Corti differ from one
another in their electromechanical properties - this may be
very important in determining frequency selectivity</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">mechanical resonance - the <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> themselves are
differently tuned</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">at the base of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a> (narrow + stiff basilar
membrane) - the <a href="outer%20hair%20cells.html">outer hair cells</a> and their stereocilia are
short + stiff</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">at the apex (more flexible basilar membrane) - <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a>
+ stereocilia are much longer and more flexible</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><em>electrical resonance</em> - the hair cell membrane shows
spontaneous voltage fluctuations/oscillations in membrane
potential around the <a href="resting%20potential.html">resting potential</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the characteristic frequency of the spontaneous electrical
oscilation in each cell matches the frequency at which the
cell is most responsive to mechanical stimuli</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the interaction of the mechanical (the physical properties
of the hair cell and its stereocilia) and electrical (the
electrical membrane characteristics of the cell)
resonances of the cell tune the hair cell to a particular
frequency (like a tuned amplifier)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">also, the <a href="outer%20hair%20cells.html">outer hair cells</a> can increase or decrease the
length of their cell bodies in response to transcellular
alternating <a href="current.html">current</a> stimulation, when maintained in
culture (Brownell)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">in reverse, the <a href="ear.html">ear</a> itself can produce sounds, termed
<em>otoacoustic emissions</em> (Kemp)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>the <a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> are innervated by bipolar neurons of the
spiral <a href="ganglion.html">ganglion</a> in the modiolus of the <a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">there are about 33,000 spiral <a href="ganglion.html">ganglion</a> cells in the human
<a href="cochlea.html">cochlea</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">approximately 90% of the fibers innervate the inner hair
cells</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">each of the 3000 <a href="inner%20hair%20cells.html">inner hair cells</a> receives contacts from
about 10 fibers, and each fiber contacts one inner hair
cells</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">the remaining 10% innervate many <a href="outer%20hair%20cells.html">outer hair cells</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">there are also some efferent fibers synapsing on outer
<a href="hair%20cells.html">hair cells</a> (which may be related to changing their length
and tuning the organ of Corti and possibly the entire
cochlear to sounds of particular interest) and on the
afferent axons innervating <a href="inner%20hair%20cells.html">inner hair cells</a></p>
