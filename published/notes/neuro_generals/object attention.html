<h2>Object <a href="attention.html">attention</a></h2>

<h3>Part of</h3>

<p><a href="attention.html">attention</a></p>


<h3>Mechanism</h3>


<h3>Visual search</h3>

<p class="first">see <a href="feature%20integration%20theory.html">feature integration theory</a></p>




<h3>Early vs late processing bottleneck</h3>

<p><a href="feature%20integration%20theory.html">feature integration theory</a> - argues for early bottleneck</p>


<h4>Rensink &amp; Enns, 1998</h4>

<p class="first">argues against early capacity limitations (as proposed by
<a href="feature%20integration%20theory.html">feature integration theory</a>)</p>

<p>search for oddly-shaped object (looks like square occluded
by circle) (cf <a href="fn2.html">fn2</a> 1265)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">pops out among squares and circles</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">however, does not pop out among squares and circles when a
circle fits right into the occluded part</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">implies that the visual system has already completed it into a
square at an early stage, before visual search</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>Duncan (1984)</h4>

<p class="first">showed that you're much better at two judgements about
features from the same object than about different objects</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so when attending to one feature of oan object, all fo the
features that make up the objet can automatically be
selected together becaues they're already linked otgether
into objects</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">suggests a late bottleneck</p>
</blockquote>




<h3>Topdown biasing (Chelazzi et al, 1998)</h3>

<p class="first">showed that many TE neurons had a higher baseline firing
rate during the day period when the cue stimulus was a
preferred stimulus for the cell than when a poor stimulus</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">could be biasing towards detecting the target</p>
</blockquote>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p class="first">some feature integration may occur preattentively</p>

<p>but other stimulus integration may require <a href="spatial%20attention.html">spatial attention</a></p>




<h3>Receptive fields</h3>

<p class="first">size of RFs increases as you go down the ventral stream
(Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">from &lt;1deg in <a href="V1.html">V1</a> to 20deg in TE</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">same for <a href="dorsal%20pathway.html">dorsal pathway</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>neurons can't send information about all of the stimuli in
their RFs at once</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">which is why the processing limitations are more obvious
at higher levels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>kastner et al, (1998) - competition in imaging</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">sequential vs simultaneous condition</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">activity in <a href="V1.html">V1</a> was the same in simultaneous and
sequential presentation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but activity in <a href="V2.html">V2</a>, and especially <a href="V4.html">V4</a> and TEO, was
reduced for simultaneous</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">mutual suppression</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">scaled to the size of the <a href="receptive%20fields.html">receptive fields</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">this mutual suppression could be partially cancelled out
by attending covertly to the stimulus location</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">strongest reduction in suppression in <a href="V4.html">V4</a> and TEO</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Saccading vs <a href="attention.html">attention</a></h3>

<p class="first">do <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a> have their own target selection mechanisms,
separate from those of visual <a href="attention.html">attention</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">Kowler et al (1995) - identify an item amidst other items,
while saccading elsewhere</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">tradeoff between identification accuracy and saccadic
latency</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>though a relatively large increment in accuracy was
achived with only small increase in saccadic latency</p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">same thing found for <a href="smooth%20pursuit.html">smooth pursuit</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">same <a href="brain.html">brain</a> structures activated in EEG for visual <a href="attention.html">attention</a> and
saccade planning</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">in monkey</p>
</blockquote>

</center>

<center>
<p><a href="superior%20colliculus.html">superior colliculus</a></p>
</center>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">but many of these neurons</p>
</blockquote>

<center>
<p>respond selectively to salient or behaviorally
relevant visual stimuli even if <a href="saccades.html">saccades</a> to such
stimuli are purposefully withheld</p>
