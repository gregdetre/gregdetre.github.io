<h3>Aka</h3>

<p><a href="Balints%20syndrome.html">Balints syndrome</a>???</p>



<h3>Part of</h3>

<p><a href="apperceptive%20agnosia.html">apperceptive agnosia</a></p>



<h3>Unimpaired</h3>

<p><a href="shape.html">shape</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">see objects as a whole</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so their  object-identification and feature
grouping processes appear to be functioning correctly</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Impaired</h3>

<p class="first">their visual <a href="attention.html">attention</a> seems to filter out all but a single
object present in the visual field</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">i.e. <a href="attention.html">attention</a>-stickiness</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Further details</h3>

<p class="first">often confused with <a href="ventral%20simultanagnosia.html">ventral simultanagnosia</a></p>

<p>although, subjects can sometimes see more than one object,
if the objects are located closely together in the visual
angle</p>

<p>almost as if they can't disengage <a href="attention.html">attention</a> from an object</p>

<p>they talk about different objects appearing and disappearing
beyond their volition</p>

<p>top-down information can influence this pre-attentive
filtering</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so the subject might first perceive wheels, handlebars and
a saddle before guessing they were seeing a bicycle, at
which point the components coalesce to form a single
object composed of a group of objects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>seem almost blind, since they are unable to localise the
single objects that their <a href="attention.html">attention</a> is stuck to</p>



<h3>Mechanism</h3>

<p class="first">usually parietal damage</p>
