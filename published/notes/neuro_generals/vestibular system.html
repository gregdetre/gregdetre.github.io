<h2>Vestibular system</h2>

<p class="first">information on movements of the head and the position of the
head relative to gravity</p>

<p><a href="angular%20acceleration.html">angular acceleration</a> = detecting rotation</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted"><a href="semi-circular%20canals.html">semi-circular canals</a> - fluid filled hoops - tell you which
way the fluid is flowing in the canals</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="linear%20acceleration.html">linear acceleration</a> = when a lift moves, or your body leans
to one side</p>

<p>very sensitive to toxins in the blood</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">you feel dizzy when drunk because the fluid in the
canals is diluted by the alcohol in your blood, causing
it to become less viscous</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">spurious vestibular signal - possible that you've got
food poisoning - you can tell it's spurious by comparing
it to <a href="vision.html">vision</a> - wired up to vomiting</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">which is why you get <a href="motion.html">motion</a> sickness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>astronauts - when they landed back, they got a sense of
their heads shooting backwards and forwards 5m with every
step</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">when you move forward, your head gets pulled down a bit</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">acceleration is basically like gravity</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">so when you get back down, and feel slight effects of
gravity, your <a href="brain.html">brain</a> interprets them as acceleration</p>
