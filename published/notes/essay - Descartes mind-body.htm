<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes uses three main arguments to establish his
conviction that the body and the mind can be distinguished, and are in fact
distinct. He quickly defines himself indubitably and essentially as a mind, a
�thinking thing�, i.e. a substance whose essence is thought. In contrast to
body, minds have no extension � they take up no space, and are indivisible. It
is not until the very end of the Mediatations that he re-establishes the
existence of an external world, much as it first seems to us, including a body
in which we operate in the corporeal world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Importantly, he states early on that he can conceive
existing without his body, yet could not conceive of his existence without his
mind. In fact, this distinction between the two, known as the <i>Argument from
Doubt</i>, leads on to the Cogito. But its purpose is to establish immediately
the idea of himself as primarily and essentially a <i>res cogitans</i>, and to
set the scene for the two later and more cogent demonstrations of the
distinction. In fact, as Arnauld shows with his example of the properties of a
right-angled triangle, it seems perfectly possible that, despite Descartes�
ability to imagine himself without a body, the body is still an essential part
of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This can be attacked from various angles. Obviously, it is
subject to the proofs which have come before it, and Descartes� explanation of
God�s lack of deception reconciled with our proneness to error. It also rests
on Descartes� restriction of his essence to being a �thinking thing�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Descartes is pressed by a similar version of Arnauld�s
attack on the argument from doubt, he introduces vaguely the notion of the mind
being a �complete thing�, because it is a substance which can exist on its own,
i.e. thought is sufficient, and the mind requires no other attributes. Not only
would he be aware of other such attributes, claims Descartes, but more
importantly, since these other attributes are not essential to the substance�s
independence of existence, they cannot be a part of its essence
(tautologically).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As shown below, this non-corporeal purity cannot be
maintained in the face of subjective phenomena which have a physical
explanation. The critical objection is simply that Descartes cannot be sure
that he could continue to think and assert the Cogito without his body, because
he might need certain of its corporeal attributes <i>in order</i> to think. As
Hobbes put it, �It may be that the thing that thinks ist he subject to which
mind, reason or intellect belong, and this subject may be something corporeal�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes defines the properties of mind and body in
mutually exclusive terms, on the basis of extensibility and divisibility. In
order to draw this contrast, he has to of course first assume divisibility of
matter, or body. Matter itself is divisible in most senses of the word (at
least down to the atomic or quark level, where it appears to become quantised
into building blocks), and our bodies can be similarly cut up into tiny pieces.
But on the other hand, they are still clearly delineated by a membrane or
barrier (usually skin), and so in another sense are a single unit, and we can
usually say what is or is not a part of our bodies. However, we will grant him
that compared to mind which seems to occupy no place or area in physical space,
matter is extensible and divisible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, his certainty that mind is indivisible, since
we cannot conceive of �half a mind� or that it has parts, seems an especially
strained conclusion to the modern reader. Though a crucial notion, it proves
one of the most problematic when trying to incorporate new ideas into
Descartes� system. The idea of discrete mind has been inexorably replaced by a
complex modular one, and he even goes some way towards it by considering that
dreams could be somehow internally-generated, or at least not reliant or
resulting from the external world. The indivisibility of mind is linked to the
notion of �perfect transparency� necessary for the Cogito. And after all, even
if Descartes� consciousness is unitary (as our language prompts us to believe,
with its easy-access pronoun, �I�), there is nothing to say that the substance
of which it is made is unitary too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having considered the arguments Descartes uses to establish
dualism, it remains to see whether such a distinction can make sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are cynics who see the <i>Meditations</i> in the light
of the intentions outlined in the <i>Letter to the Sorbonne. </i>There are even
those who point to what happened to Galileo when his discoveries created
difficulties for the Church to resolve, and claim that Descartes chose the easy
life by ensuring that his treatise fitted largely with religious doctrine. But
assuming, as seems very likely, that Descartes really held his religious
beliefs, one wonders whether a religious motivation underlies Descartes� entire
enterprise and dictates its course. Of course, if his arguments are solid, then
his motivations would be almost irrelevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But despite the superficial appeal of dualism, Descartes�
formulation of it is so strained in some areas that the reader might be
forgiven for wondering. Leaving God aside, the equivalence of soul and mind is
the obvious first step to proving the immortality of the soul. To do this, he
has to assign our essence as being �thought�, couched in such terms as to
include the functions of the traditional soul. He also has to downplay the
value and bond to our bodies in order to leave free the possibility of the
soul�s existence continuing after the trivial �change in shape and
configuration� that is death; Plato�s strained metaphors and arguments are
testament to the difficulty of directly proving that we have an immortal soul.
This absoluteness leads him to further untenable conclusions, such as that the
soul is continually thinking, assumedly even during breaks in wakefulness (but
during <i>unconsciousness</i> too?). In conclusion, though Descartes would find
some aspects of his dualistic distinction easier to explain, it couldn't be
claimed that it is solely Descartes� religious agenda which undermines his
dualism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps the single largest problem for Descartes� dualism
lies in the sharpness of the divide between mind and body. He leaves almost no
room for the interaction between the two that takes place, for instance when
events in the corporeal world cause the subjective sensation in my mind of
pain. On the other hand, later writings which talk of scarcely-understood
mechanical or �gravitational� forces acting on a mind located in the pineal
gland hardly simplify the issue of how our will acts back on the body in the
form of motor control. Descartes admitted his bafflement regarding this
insoluble �ghost in the machine� in his conversation with Burman. Indeed, the
psycho-physical even clouds the purity of his definition of �thinking�, when it
becomes apparent that �imagination� and �having sense perceptions� involve the
body by Descartes� own admission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descartes� ends up implying almost trialism, with his list
of �primitive� categories having to include a �union� of body and mind to
accommodate the �sensations and passions� � this is what he admits in a letter
to Elizabeth in 1643. Such a trialism would be necessary to distinguish between
animals and inanimate objects, although Descartes carefully avoids that this
third category is distinct in ontological, as opposed to epistemological terms.
Perhaps it would be easier and make as much sense to say that it is these
subjective phenomena are primary, with thought being abstracted from them and
matter being acted upon as a result of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strawson sees the fundamental difficulty of the Cartesian
standpoint as being one of identity: how �I� can be sure what �I� am and where
the �I� stops. He claims that it is only by seeing the mind as being a feature
of body, just as a surface needs a table to be a surface of, or (to use one of
Descartes analogies) a mountain and a valley are inseparable. Strawson attacks
the intelligibility of the idea of mind without body by attacking the idea of a
conscious Self being able to identify itself as a unique and enduring entity.
He uses Margaret Wilson�s query of how such a consciousness would be able to
differentiate itself from any one of a plethora of consciousnesses, all
simultaneously thinking the same thought. He also uses Kant�s attack on Locke�s
theory of the Self�s assurance of unity through time because of memory: though
we are conscious of ourselves as having a �stream� continuously flowing
uni-directionally through time, why might we not be a succession of evolving,
static mental states? Strawson�s anti-Cartesian stance says that we can only
regard ourselves as a �person� when we have a body to give us identity as an
individual, with applicable criteria for establishing and delineating our
presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet I cannot see how the body is any less subject to both
arguments � why might not a body be inhabited by many identical consciousnesses
all dictating the same actions simultaneously, unaware of their cohabitance?
Descartes doesn't address the problem of multiple consciousnesses, although if
they are indistinguishable and never deviate, they are <i>all</i> �I�. And as
for the body�s continued existence through time, Descartes did consider this,
taking recourse in God to preserve us through continual re-creation. For those
who find this unsatisfying, television is the most powerful example of how easily
we can be fooled by the illusion of continuity when faced with a rapid
succession of discrete instants, depriving us of confidence about our body�s
continued existence in time. So it seems that Strawson is providing no greater
assurance of personal identity by describing ourselves as body-minds than a
dualist Cartesian can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moreover, Strawson ignores the issue that Hume raises, of
whether we can meaningfully talk of a central �Self�, as Locke and Descartes
assume. Russell notes that a parallel between Berkeley�s removal of substance
from physics with this repudiation of substance in philosophy of mind. When
Hume tries to centre on �myself�, he always stumbles on some particular
perception or other, never managing to catch the <i>myself</i> at any time
without a perception, and never being able to observe anything but the
perception. The echoes of this argument are still audible in the contrasting
substrate and bundle models with which Desscartes� views on how properties
adhere to objects can be understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The �powerful illusion� (as Kant termed it) of dualism is
that, even in the context of modern neuroscience and strong philosophical
arguments against it, it feels intuitively valid somehow. In short, <i>my</i>
mind �feels� different from <i>my</i> body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that Descartes� most infamous declarations figure
prominently in every modern physiology textbook is a testament to the
importance of the issues he addresses. However, the same textbooks unanimously
declare his dualistic explanations to be outdated, in line with the prevailing
view that the complexity of the nervous system (and possibly the rest of the
body) provides sufficient explanation in physiological terms to account for the
mystery of consciousness, which is the direction in which the debate has
shifted. It seems appropriate to spend a little time reviewing whether current
thought on the subject can be reconciled with Cartesian notions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In partial defence of a dualistic metaphysics, Nagel�s quest
for objectivity parallels the method of doubt. When discussing mind�s relation
to body, Nagel feels able to dismiss what he terms a solely �<i>physical</i>
conception of objectivity� in a few short pages. He describes three phenomena
irreducible in monistic, purely physical terms: the qualitative jump to
subjective phenomena and features of conscious mental processes; the fact that
even though we can �climb outside of our own minds� to a centreless,
featureless �bleached-out� conception of the physical world, this does not
explain where these perspectives and specific viewpoints �left behind as
irrelevant to physics� come from; and the mental activity involved in
analytically objectivising our viewpoint in the first place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps the most powerful evidence that the mental can
somehow be expressed in corporeal terms stems from the field of neuroscience.
This evidence has an empirical basis, which of course strictly depends on the
rationalist constructions of the first five Meditations for its validity. That
aside, there can be little doubt that our minds are influenced by the physiology
of our bodies in a far more direct way than Descartes could have envisioned.
With minimal hyperbole, science can claim to have given crude sight to the
blind by producing coded neural impulses in the visual system of the brain,
which equate to subjective phenomena like edges and colours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Body�s erosion over mind is complete for most theorists.
However, misconceptions and considerable debate remain over just how the
brain�s <i>structure</i> could produce consciousness. To illustrate, I will
outline two models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Higher-order theory (<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>hot</span>)
focuses on the ability to have thoughts about thoughts (or doubts about
doubts), i.e. mental events which don't take direct perceptions as their
object, but each other. It is difficult to conceive how the state of an array
of neuronal activity can take its own state as the internal representation
being formed, unless we take the obvious step of compartmentalising the various
functions of the brain, e.g. perception, working memory, language etc. However,
this shatters yet another Cartesian premise, the indivisibility of mind.
Damasio�s comprehensive attempt at an explanation of �emotion, reason and the
human brain� further reduces the credibility of an indivisible mind, with its
explanation of the seeming unity of our awareness in terms of the synchronicity
of mental activity in separate areas of the brain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dennett�s �multiple drafts theory� posits a complex
machinery of independent and limited �agents� in the mind; the mental
pandemonium that results from their interaction is enough to generate
goal-directed behaviour and conscious cognition. This illustrates Dennett�s
keenness to avoid the misconceived scenario of a homunculus inside a �Cartesian
theatre� which arises when we think about a �Self� at the highest-order controls
of our thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It remains to say that Descartes� arguments for mind/body
distinction are amongst the most contested in the Meditations. Moreover, his
own writing betrays the incompatibility inherent in dualism, and the difficulty
of incorporating the subjective phenomena which take both mind and body as
their domain. Now, with fairly plausible explanations of a materialist basis
for mind, the alternatives to dualism appear even more compelling, despite its
intuitive attraction.</p>
