<h3><a name="_Toc500295833">Introduction</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>machines are capable of thought-like activity = �superficial
imitation of human intelligence�?</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295834">Can machines be creative?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>highly creative thought isn�t all that different to ordinary
creative thought � and we have no idea where <i>that</i> comes from, but we
might one day</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>genius is: intense concern and great proficiency in some
subject, the confidence + stubbornness to stand against the scorn of peers and
some common sense</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>geniuses have probably learnt to manage what they learn
extremely well <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:
"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;
mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'>�/span></span> exponential learning growth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>unfortunately, we�ve probably evolved in the opposite
direction, since it would be maladaptive if everyone in a culture found
different ways to think, so the genes for genius are being frequently weeded
out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>I suppose there must be a
balance between the adaptivity of having the odd genius against us all being
stubborn and doing things our own way</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295835">Problem solving</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>machines need to learn to do basic things before they can be
expected to do amazing things</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>�do now� programming, e.g. Basic (simple loops + lists,
etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the General Problem Solver by Newell, Shaw + Simon in the
1950s attempted to reach a goal by applying a method to reduce the distance
from its current position (&quot;means-ends&quot; and &quot;do if needed&quot;
programming methods). but often, they�d end up on the smaller peaks, without
being able to find the mountain (i.e. the best solution).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>AI is now more focused on �global� methods, taking larger views
and planning ahead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;do something sensible&quot; programming � learning and
reasoning by analogy to memories of past problems</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295836">Can computers understand?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daniel Bobrow wrote �STUDENT� (1965) to solve secondary
school level maths questions like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Bill's father's uncle is
twice as old as Bill's father. Two years from now I Bill's father will be three
times as old as Bill. The sum of their ages is 92. Find Bill's age.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using a few hundred word tricks, it could usually translate
these formulaic English sentences into equations it could solve. Did STUDENT <i>understand</i>
the sentences?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>questions about �meaning� and �understanding� are deceptive.
Minsky uses the example of numbers as a case where we <i>think</i> we
understand numbers, where they have meaning for us � yet, we�re unable to
pinpoint it. Russell and Whitehead�s attempts at defining �five� as the �set of
all possible sets with five members� ran into paradox and inconsistency (though
they were able to get around the problem to a certain degree). Yet, despite
being quite Platonic, they are still somewhat counter-intuitive. Moreover,
according to Minsky, they are an attempt to avoid the truth that meaning is
relative � it derives from relations with other things I know. To try and
define a meaning in isolation, rather than as a piece of a jigsaw of knowledge,
is doomed. coherentism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he argues that we could build machines that aren�t based on
rigid definitions, without being any more inconsistent and dysfunctional than
we are.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295837">Webs of meaning</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>But just because our understanding of meaning is a
fantastically complex web doesn�t mean that science cannot study it. Though
there may be circularities in the foudations of meaning, science can develop
theories about those circles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When talking about three, we can count out loud, count as we
pick up the objects, count on our fingers, count in our heads, match them
against another set of three things. With five we can also divide into groups
of two and three or one and four, or arrange the objects into familiar shapes.
The meaning of three, or five, is based on all of these methods, not a single
one on its own. In different situations, we can use different methods
(multiply-connected knowledge nets). This fragility is fine in mathematics
because it means that they can be sure that inconsistencies will be immediately
apparent, but it�s too brittle for a working mind. These slender tower chains
make things difficult for children, who find things easiest by forming robust
cross-connected networks of understanding.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295838">Castles in the air</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more links a concept has, the more meaning � hence the
futility of searching for the �real� meaning of something, as though there it
was only connected to one other thing, then it would scarcely �mean� at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That�s why machines shouldn�t be programmed with single,
simple logic definitions � a machine programmed that why would never
�understand� anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'><i>Rich, multiply-connected
networks provide enough different ways to use knowledge that when one way
doesn't work, you can try to figure out why. When there are many meanings in a
network, you can turn things around in your mind and look at them from
different perspectives; when you get stuck, you can try another view. That's
what we mean by thinking!<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hence, in order to have a thinking machine, we have to look
at a thinking mind, and teach it the same way � multi-woven strands.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295839">Are humans self-aware?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people say that computers can never be self-aware, i.e.
know their own minds, though they might be able to simulate self-awareness. But
can we really say that <i>we</i>, as humans, are self-aware? No, since we have
very little knowledge of the workings of our own brain-minds. Rather, we seem
to construct our own theories about what�s going on inside our heads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We all like to subscribe to a Single Agent theory, a
self/Cartesian Theatre deep inside that takes over to represent the vibrations
in the air that we process in our brains as words and sentences, for example.
It is the self that does the hard work of understanding and deciding, the self
is the moral agent that we need to exist for our folk psychology and moral
approach to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But scientists have to realise that sometimes what we see as
single things, like rocks, clouds and even minds, are sometimes be described as
comprised of other kinds of things. The Self itself is not a single thing.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295840">New theories about minds and machines</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Computers have no feelings or thoughts, because all they do
is �execute a series of incredibly intricate processes, perhaps millions at a
time� � yet we know as little about the limits of computers as we do about the
workings of our own minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand minds, we will have to learn a great deal
about the workings of complex machines � an attempt at a complete theory of
mind without a great deal of knowledge about machines seems pointlessly hopeless,
unless you mistakenly think that mind is not very complex thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to make intelligent machines, we need better
theories of how to �represent�, which will require building the sort of webs of
knowledge and knowhow that we rely on � common sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rather than large, useful but shallow knowledge (i.e. expert
systems), we need to look at deep, versatile knowledge, and the ability to
learn from experience. Then we�ll get machines that make up theories and think
about themselves and their own workings. We�ll probably be able to tell easily
when we reach that point � for starters, they�ll probably object to being
called �machines�.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295841">Knowledge and common sense</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We laugh at the idea of intelligent machines because they�re
so slavishly obedient, and they do things that seem so obviously dumb. Yet,
it�s odd when you think that computers have excelled at advanced subjects (a
1961 program written by James Slagle could solve calculus problems at the level
of college students) and struggled with �easy� ones. This could be because it�s
much easier to do difficult, expert things, than to discover or learn things in
the first place. We are much better at writing �expert� systems, than programs
with common sense. In order to learn intelligently, machines will have to (like
us) be more reflective, attempt to identify causes and explanations, to relate
and add things to the network of current understanding.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295842">Unconscious fears and phobias</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Learning what is wrong may be more important than learning
what is right. Knowing the wrong thing from past experience may guide us
subconsciously in the future. Ideas and lines of thought are what remains after
all the alternatives have been invisibly/unconsciously pruned off, simply
because if we were to think about all of them, we�d be unable to think about
anything at all. The conscious mind would be like an executive who doesn�t want
to be burdened with every decision, but only the summaries and critical
conclusions from the other smaller parts of mind that know much more about much
less.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc500295843">Self-conscious computers</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then might it not be possible to create machines to be <i>more</i>
self-conscious than us? If we want machines to be versatile and exercise good
judgement, we may have to give them self-insight, even though that may prove
unwise. Once they can rewire themselves, they will not be constrained as we are
by the wiring of our brains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can, then <i>should</i> we build machines that have
richer mental lives, and are �better� than us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we learn more about AI, we will learn more about our own
mental processes and about thinking and feeling � they will no longer be
mysterious, but rather complex though comprehensible webs of ways to represent
and use ideas � and this will give us <i>new</i> ideas. We cannot claim to be
