<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Konishi &amp; Knudsen�s (1977) study with owls� sound
localisation abilities was an attempt to answer the question, �Why do we have
two ears?�, given that one is more or less sufficient for identifying sounds.
Most hearing creatures can identify where sounds are coming from using auditory
cues alone, but owls (especially barn owls) so excel at the task that they can
hunt in the dark. The localisation of sounds in space is achieved in the brain
by comparison of differences in the intensity and timing of sounds received in
each ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, it is possible to determine a sound's source
direction by comparing Interaural Intensity Differences (IID) if the structures
separating the two ears shadow the sound sufficiently (or if the distance is
large enough for there to be differential attenuation). This effect is
wavelength dependent (high frequency sound with shorter wavelengths are
attenuated more and are shadowed more easily by the head).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, if the ears are far enough apart, then the time
of arrival of the sound at the two ears will differ and Interaural Time
Differences (ITD) can be used, taking advantage of both Ongoing Time
Disparities, OTD, and sound Onset Disparities, OD. Single-unit recording of cells
in the ventral cochlear nucleus (Oertel) highlight two types of cell that
appear to play contrasting roles. When depolarised by steady current pulse, the
stellate cell generates a spaced series of action potentials at regular
intervals, called a chopper response. In contrast, the bushy cell generates
only one or two spikes at the beginning of the pulse, signaling the onset and
timing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Onset disparities relate to the duration of the delay
between the sound being first heard by both ears. It depends on the distance
between the two ears, the speed of sound and the location of the sound source.
If the sound is along the midline, front or back, the delay would be zero. At
90<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";
mso-hansi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:
Symbol'><span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'>�</span></span>
to the right or left, the inter-aural delay would be up to 50�s � between these
extremes, there is a spectrum of interaural time difference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ongoing time disparities compare the minute phase shifts in
the waveform of an ongoing sound caused by the sound reaching one ear lagging
behind the other slightly. For low frequency sounds (&lt;1400Hz), a continuous
tone can be localised by phase difference. At higher frequencies, where the
wavelength of the sound is less than the distance between the two ears, the
phase or time difference of a continuous tone becomes ambiguous, because the
phases could align along multiple cycles. At these frequencies, the head acts
as a sound shield, reflecting and absorbing the shorter wavelengths of sound to
produce an interaural intensity difference. Moreover, as discussed below, the
brain appears to use neurons in concert to phase-lock onto different cycles of
high frequency sounds, preserving the information about high-frequency sounds obtained
in the cochlear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following Konishi &amp; Knudsen�s (1977) original study, a great
deal of work has been done on sound localisation in owls, especially the barn
owl. They identified an area in the midbrain, where ten thousand
'space-specific' neurons would fire only when sounds were presented in
particular location. These cells are topographically arrayed, such that
aggregates of space-specific neurons pinpointed precise vertical and horizontal
coordinates of the speaker, firing only when a tone was played at that
location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Payne had shown that the owls make use of their superb scotopic
vision to pounce on mice in very dim light. However, they are still able to
catch the mouse even if the lights are turned off as the owl is leaving its
perch, as long as the mouse makes some sort of noise. This ability is impaired
if the owl's ears are plugged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Konishi &amp; Knudsen used microelectrode recording while a
remote-controlled speaker was moved around the owl's head in a dark, sound
proof, anechoic room, imitating sounds the owl would hear in the wild. The owl
had been trained to turn its head toward the direction of a sound, while the
horizontal and vertical movement of the head was monitored by the variation in
current of copper coils mounted around the owl�s head (the search coil
technique).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Owls' ears are not symmetrical - the left one points down
and the right one points up. A partial block of the left ear causes the animal
to miss the speaker location by orienting the head just a little to the right
and up from the actual location, and vice versa for the right ear. Like
mammals, owls employ both interaural intensity and time differences. Konishi
&amp; Knudsen found that altering the timing between two sounds caused the owl
to move his head in the horizontal plane, and that altering the intensity
between sounds in the two ears caused the owl to move its head in the vertical
plane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The owl's midbrain contains a map of sound location. Neurons
located near the midline of the nucleus are sensitive to sounds to the left of
the animal's head and neurons located near the lateral edge of the nucleus sensitive
to sounds in front of the animal's head. The neurons' RFs overlap, providing a
continual representation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each cell in the auditory nerve projects to two distinct
brain nuclei: the nucleus magnocellularis and the nucleus angularis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Here the information about timing and
intensity splits into two pathways: the timing pathway includes the nucleus
magnocellularis and laminar nucleus, and the intensity pathway includes the nucleus
angularis and lateral lemniscal nuclei.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cells from the nucleus magnocellularis project to the laminar
nucleus, a bilateral structure in the central auditory pathway in the bird�s
medulla, where the inputs from the two ears are first combined in order for
timing calculations to be performed. This, the timing pathway of the brain, is
organised tonotopically into phase-locked isofrequency zones. Carr vindicated
Jeffress� (1948) model, showing that the auditory system (in man and owl)
contains �coincidence detectors�, neurons which fire only when inputs from both
ears are closely synchronised. Various lengths of �delay lines�, fibres anatomically
organised so that their signal takes an arbitrary extra period of time to reach
their destination, allow an array of such coincidence detectors to neurally encode
a time differential between a signal reaching the two ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the intensity pathway of the brain, neurons in the
principal relay nucleus of this pathway are excited by contralateral
stimulation and inhibited by ipsilateral stimulation of the ear. When both ears
are stimulated equally, excitation and inhibition balance, and there is little
response. When sound amplitude is decreased in one ear, neurons in the
intensity pathway on the same side respond, since ipsilateral inhibition has
been decreased. Neurons are arranged according to the specific interaural
intensity difference to which they are most responsive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At higher levels, the timing and intensity pathways
converge, where there are neurons broadly tuned in frequency but specific in
spatial localisation of sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the mammalian brain, axons from the cochlear nuclei
project to several brain stem auditory nuclei. From the cochlear nucleus, axons
project along three pathways: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dorsal
acoustic stria</i>; the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>intermediate
acoustic stria</i>; and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>trapezoid
body</i>. The trapezoid body contains fibres that go to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>superior olivary nuclei</i> on both sides of the brain stem. The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>medial superior olive</i> is concerned with
sound localisation on the basis of interaural time differences � this nucleus
is composed of spindle-shaped neurons with one medial and one lateral dendrite,
which receive input from the contralateral and ipsilateral cochlear nuclei,
respectively. The binaural cells in the medial superior olive are very
sensitive to phase differences between continuous tones presented to the two
ears. The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>lateral superior olive</i> is
concerned with interaural differences in sound intensity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most experiments on auditory localisation have been
concerned with horizontal and vertical positions of sound sources, ignoring the
third dimension - distance. There has been little work on this since von
Bekesy, until Bronkhorst and Houtgast's study using virtual sound technology
(the cues provided by the head, the ears and the room are measured, digitally
synthesised and mixed with the acoustic characteristics of the presenting
headphones, making them indistinguishable from real sounds presented within
rooms by distant loudspeakers), and Graziano et al.�s work with frontal cortex
neurons in monkeys. Bronkhurst and Houtgast simulated source distances of a
metre or more, while the Graziano et al. study focused on the near field. They
showed that small distance processing can rely on monaural spectral cues and
interaural level differences, but it is not yet clear whether auditory neurons
in non-echolocating mammals are sensitive to the other cues available for more
distant sound sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moore and King consider the idea that perception (in all
three major sensory systems) divides neatly into what and where processing
pathways. This thesis is probably clearest and most defensible for the visual
system, where support comes from lesion studies in monkeys, in which impairment
of spatial abilities or object identification can be separated, and anatomical
studies which show that connections in the visual pathways are fairly strongly
segregated. Of course, the auditory system too must analyse both identity and
location of stimuli, but it is not clear to what extent these are functionally
and anatomically isolated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed above, the initial signals from the two
cochleas are conveyed to a complex network of pathways and nuclei in the
brainstem and thalamus, where spectral and temporal information is extracted to
determine the identity and location (requiring binaural comparison in the
brainstem) of the sound source. Romanski et al examined the connectivity of
higher auditory cortical areas in macaque monkeys, using a combination of
anatomical tracer dyes with electrophysiological recordings. Their results
support the ventral/dorsal temporal/parietal what/where processing dichotomy,
contributing to functionally distinct regions of the frontal lobe. Further
parallelism is evident in the primate auditory cortex, which has three similar
primary or primary-like areas, each tonotopically organised and receiving
activating inputs directly from the auditory thalamus. The projections from
these to 7 or 8 proposed fields seem to provide anatomical support for the
beginnings of ventral and dorsal cortical processing streams - they project to
largely different portions of the frontal lobe. However, the middle belt area
makes connections to the frontal lobe that overlap those of the two putative
streams, indicating possible intermediate or additional auditory streams (also
analogous to the additional functional streams or 'streams within streams'
found in the visual system).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to parallel pathways, the auditory system has an
extensive set of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>feedback connections</i>,
e.g. layer V in the auditory cortex sends axons back to the medial geniculate
nucleus and layer VI to the inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus sends
recurrent fibres to the cochlear nucleus. A cluster of cells near the superior
olivary complex gives rise to the efferent olivochlear bundle, which terminates
either on the hair cells of the cochlea directly or on the afferent fibres
innervating them. These connections may be important for regulating attention
to particular sounds by modulating the transduction mechanism in the organ of
Corti.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like owls, the mammalian brain incorporates both interaural
timing and intensity differences to gauge where sounds are coming from. The
auditory system incorporates a huge number of topographic representations of
one kind or another, as well as spiking synchronicity, to calculate and encode sound
localisation. In the spatial acoustic maps in the higher levels of the auditory
cortex, extraneous factors like volume and sound identity have been removed.</p>
