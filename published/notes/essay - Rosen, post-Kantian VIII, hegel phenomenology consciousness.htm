Rosen, post-Kantian VIII</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel intended the Phenomenology as an introduction to his
system, and referred to it as such in his later Science of Logic and
Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences. Indeed, he had made plans for the
publication of a second edition before his death. However, he developed an
increasingly critical attitude towards this project of a phenomenological
introduction to the system, and adopted instead a discussion concerning three
different ï¿½attitudes of thought to objectivityï¿½.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The opening chapters of the <i>Phenomenology</i> can be seen
as epistemological. They highlight the difficulty of forming a conception of
oneself within the world that can be justified except by reference to reasons
that themselves require justification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first chapter, on ï¿½Sense-certaintyï¿½, begins by discussing
a form of consciousness that takes in only the most immediate aspects of
experience, what we would now term ï¿½sense dataï¿½. Hegel considers that such a
consciousness, if it could take in sensory information without processing it at
all, would yield ï¿½immediate knowledgeï¿½, for whenever our conceptual net
intervenes, it inevitably filters out certain things. When we describe a
ï¿½brownï¿½, ï¿½woodenï¿½ ï¿½tableï¿½, although this conception may be accurate, it is
still lacking, and cannot be seen except as ï¿½mediatedï¿½ and containing implicit
concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We might then think that the ï¿½concrete content of sense
certaintyï¿½ offers the richest, truest knowledge ï¿½ but Hegel shows, with the
dialectic, that in fact, it provides on the ï¿½abstractest and poorest truthï¿½.
Taylor regards Hegel as believing that being able to ï¿½sayï¿½ is one of the
ï¿½criterial properties of knowingï¿½. Soll thinks that Taylorï¿½s interpretation of
Hegel misses the philosophical consequence of Hegelï¿½s actual claim, since
Taylor allows us to have described something adequately even if we
ï¿½stumblinglyï¿½ and ï¿½badlyï¿½ attempt it with words like ï¿½ineffableï¿½. But Soll
argues convincingly that such a view would have been anathema to Hegel, who
calls ineffability the ï¿½untrueï¿½ and ï¿½irrationalï¿½. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taylor views the argument for the poverty of sense certainty
as resting on its ï¿½refusal to be selectiveï¿½. He points to the contradiction of
a non-selective consciousness, that since consciousness <i>is</i> awareness, it
cannot be anything but selective. Soll argues that Hegel is not discussing the
selectivity of sense certainty yet, but rather the meagreness of its
descriptions. The only thing that sense certainty can say about the object of
its consciousness is that ï¿½it isï¿½, it cannot describe the contents of
consciousness as anything but ï¿½beingï¿½. Hegel is saying not so much that the
contents of knowable consciousness reside in being able to say anything about
it, as what you can say about it ï¿½ and in the case of sense certainty, it is
then a form of consciousness, but the poorest form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel then argues that sense certainty cannot be aware of
particulars, but only of universals. He considers the words ï¿½thisï¿½, ï¿½nowï¿½,
ï¿½hereï¿½ and ï¿½Iï¿½, as universals ï¿½ they fail to refer to particulars or
individuals in a way that is independent of the context of their use. We all
say ï¿½I thinkï¿½, to refer to ourselves ï¿½ it is a universal, rather than a
particular ï¿½Iï¿½. Taylor takes the ensuing sections to be a discussion of
ostensive definition, the means by which I might know the definitions of a
sensation in order to have a criterion for applying a name. Soll argues that
there is no textual evidence for such a discussion in Hegel, even though it
does support his conclusions. Instead, Hegel appears to be pointing to a more
elementary problem in our use of the term ï¿½nowï¿½, simply that the now will have
already passed by the time we have pointed to it. The solution of saying that
the present spans some tiny but finite period of time during which we might
refer to it within it, changes the meaning of ï¿½nowï¿½. This is a dialectical
development, and turns ï¿½nowï¿½ into a universal, since it refers to an absolute
group of ï¿½nowï¿½s all at once, a kind of conglomeration of instants. For Hegel,
it is a question of assigning ï¿½nowï¿½ some scope, rather than a specific scope
which raises the problems of ostensive definition and boundaries that Taylor
considers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for Hegel to be able to generalise his critique of
ï¿½nowï¿½ as a univeral all the way to ï¿½thisï¿½, is to apply a similar procedure to
ï¿½hereï¿½. But this is slightly more problematic than he seems to assume, because
even if it takes a noticeable amount of time for us to point out a ï¿½hereï¿½, we
have still succeeded in referring to a particular. The exact issues of
referring in time are not the same as referring in space. However, there is
some analogy, insofar as ï¿½hereï¿½ admits of infinite subdivisions in the same way
that ï¿½nowï¿½ does, and can be regarded as a ï¿½pluralityï¿½ of ï¿½hereï¿½s. In this
sense, ï¿½hereï¿½ is a universal too, and so ï¿½thisï¿½ must be too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leaves Hegel open to one last major criticism: his lack
of distinction between universal and whole. As Soll rightly points out, to
demonstrate that time and space are infinitely subdividable does not in itself
show that a region of time or space cannot be a particular comprised of (an infinite
number of) parts. Indeed, it is upon this criticism that his major point
stands. When Hegel refers to ï¿½hereï¿½ and ï¿½nowï¿½ as universals, he is not so much
making a statement about our ability to express them only as universals, but
about their status as such. It is in this way that he attacks sense certainty,
as misdirectedly trying to appeal to universals as particulars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">ï¿½</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegel moves to show that the resulting understanding, that
of consciousness as having a universal (conceptual) aspect, gives rise to what
he terms ï¿½perceptionï¿½, where the universality of the contents of consciousness
must be publicly apprehensible. But this in turn generates contradictions that
are irresolvable by conventional means, setting the stage for Hegelï¿½s
ï¿½speculativeï¿½ philosophical reasoning by dialectic. Otherwise, we are mired in
a series of ï¿½formations of consciousnessï¿½ ï¿½ this is Hegelï¿½s term for a
world-view that is based on assumptions, i.e. ï¿½appearancesï¿½ ï¿½ and no single
ï¿½formation of consciousnessï¿½ can be objectively any more valid than any other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a literary way, the <i>Phenomenology</i> is almost trying
to historicise (in the Hegelian sense) a consciousnessï¿½s attempt at
understanding itself. As each ï¿½formation of consciousnessï¿½ replaces the one
before, we are moving towards the triumphal conclusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the <i>Phenomenology</i> is about social or ethical
issues, so it seems curious that it opens with an epistemological discussion.
But Hegel regarded this as essential, since all of his works are intended to be
self-justifying. His intention is to move from subjective spirit to objective
spirit, so that he could proceed to the exposition of his <i>Sittlichkeit</i>.
In order to become objective, consciousness must become self-conscious, since
it ï¿½requires the conscious subject to be aware of itself as a subject for whom
something other, an object, is presented as something knownï¿½ (Redding,
Stanford). This marks the shift towards patterns of mutual recognition of
consciousness, and those around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <i>Phenomenology</i> could be seen as attempting two
things:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l0 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:list .5in'>highlighting
     the contradictions inherent in our supposedly natural picture of the
     world, and so destroying it</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-align:left;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo6;tab-stops:
     list .5in;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>breaking down our view of the world
     as outside and separate to us, instead representing ourselves and the
     world as ï¿½<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.5pt'>a structural unity with
     the essential characteristic of self-knowledge and thus being conscious of
     itselfï¿½ (Graham, Routledge). &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hegelï¿½s system can be seen as serving two purposes to the
modern reader. On the one hand, it highlights many of the internal conflicts
within 18th century materialism, mainly along the lines of the
subjective/objective divide, some of which are still major issues. It also
provides a resolution for these conflicts, in a powerful and novel way. By
treating the self and the world as identical, as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Geist</i>, the problem breaks down entirely. Hegelï¿½s idealism is far
purer and more coherent than, say, Berkeleyï¿½s, in that it requires no
sub-division into ï¿½spiritsï¿½ and ï¿½ideasï¿½. Rather, it is wholly monist in seeing
the entire world as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Geist</i>, as
intelligible self-conscious structure. The identities Hegel requires to found
his system seem strained, but if accepted, ensure that it coheres in a very
satisfying way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can see his discussion of sense-certainty in the <i>Phenomenology</i>
as a microcosm of his larger systematic effort to release oneself from the
ï¿½finitude of reflectionï¿½ by means of the dialectic. The <i>Phenomenology</i> is
based on his conviction that all of a consciousnessï¿½s epistemic attitudes
towards a material world can be seen as relations between ï¿½cognitionï¿½ and
ï¿½truthï¿½. ï¿½Knowledgeï¿½ is that epistemic relation when ï¿½cognitionï¿½ (subject) and
ï¿½truthï¿½ (object) correspond with each other, which for Hegel requires them to
be identical. In order for this to be the case, neither cognition nor truth can
be formulated in an internally inconsistent manner. Given all this, knowledge
can really only be seen as self-knowledge.</p>
