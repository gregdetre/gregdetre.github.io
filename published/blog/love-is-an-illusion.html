      <h2>Love is an illusion</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>it's not so much that there is no such thing, but that love is not transcendent, it's biological. humanity is so attached to the exalted position it holds in its own collective head, that it cannot cannot exist as a biological animal to itself. whether reason, language, astronomy, religion, creativity, sympathy, empathy or love divide us from the brute beasts, we need to maintain the illusion. the fear is that there's nothing left if we allow ourselves to abandon these romantic notions one by one</p>
