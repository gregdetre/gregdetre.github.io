    <p><a href="http://pyepl.sourceforge.net/">PyEPL</a> (the Python Experiment-Programming Library) is a versatile, high-level library for coding psychology experiments in Python. If you run human experiments and like coding, then I'd recommend it strongly.  </p>
<p>PyEPL's adoption and utility would both receive a tremendous boost if there were a wider array of snippets and tutorials floating around, so I created a <a href="http://pyepl.blogspot.com/">collaborative PyEPL blog</a> to provide an unofficial home for such tutorials, snippets and discussion. See the <a href="http://pyepl.blogspot.com/2008/08/motivation-for-creating-this-blog.html">announcement post</a> for more info.  </p>
<p>N.B. I wouldn't recommend PyEPL in its current form for low-level vision experiments, and it only runs on Mac and Linux. Both these concerns are slowly being addressed though, so things may have changed since the time of writing.</p>
