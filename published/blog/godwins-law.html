      <h2>Godwin's Law</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>Also from <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a>:</p>
<p>"Godwin's Law: As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.</p>
<p>popularly understood as "the first person in an argument to refer to Hitler or the Nazis loses the argument", but it isn't a law like "murder is a crime" is a law. It's more like Newton's Laws--not something that can be "invoked" or "violated", but an observation of the surrounding world.</p>
<p>Godwin's corollary: When someone takes an unofficial "law" like Godwin's or Moore's too seriously and writes new corollaries for it, they automatically lose.</p>
