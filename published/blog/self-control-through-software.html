      <h2>Self Control through software</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lefstathiou">Leo Efstathiou</a> asked me recently whether I'd rather be smarter, or have more willpower. It took only a moment's thought to realize that I'd rather have the self-control any time.  </p>
<p>And so it was with a sense of wonder and optimism that I normally reserve for sunrises that I fired up <a href="http://visitsteve.com/work/selfcontrol/">Self Control</a>: a Mac application that completely blacklists parts of the Internet. Like a gaoler with a blackjack, Self Control coshes any attempt to blunder down rabbit holes like Facebook or email for some time period you specify. It's absolutely and delightfully watertight.  </p>
<p>The beauty of this is its potential long-term effect. I want to counteract the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001302.html">variable reinforcement schedule that email and blogs</a> provide - with Self Control's help, I'm hoping to ensure zero reward from them for long enough to break the self-perpetuating cycle of reflexive refresh-pressing.</p>
