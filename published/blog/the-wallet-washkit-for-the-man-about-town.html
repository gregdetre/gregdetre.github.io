    <p>Have you ever charged out into the night like an angry banshee in search of entertainment, only to have your forwards momentum sapped from you by the bulkiness of your encumbrances? Then look no further than the Wallet Washkit For The Man About Town, available only at ThinkChic.com.</p>
<p>No thicker than an ordinary wallet, but packed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>micro-toothbrush and paste, designed by NASA to function in zero-G, and employed by astronauts on Apollo</li>
<li>chewing gum that would make even Willy Wonka giggle with delight at its olfactory potency</li>
<li>oozing gel that turns your wallet into a roll-on deodorant</li>
<li>aphoristic reading material that fits on credit-card-sized pages.</li>
</ul>
