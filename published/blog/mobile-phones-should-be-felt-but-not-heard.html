      <h2>Mobile phones should be felt but not heard</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>I can never hear or feel my phone when it rings, no matter how loudly or how insistently hornet-like the trilling and shrilling and buzzing and fuzzing.  </p>
<p>For this reason, I got very excited when I heard that they now make a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/12/09/the-vibrating-bluetooth-bracelet/">Bluetooth bracelet that buzzes when your phone rings</a>.  </p>
<p>Better still though, I'd like a sticky Bluetooth (Gluetooth?) doodad that you could affix to a watchstrap or a belt or a ring that stayed charged by dynamo from the kinetic energy of my movements - that would be much less obtrusive.</p>
