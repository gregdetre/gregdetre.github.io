    <p>When it comes to tools, I am a hedgehog rather than a fox. I like to have a small number of tools, and to know them well.</p>
<p>I recently resolved to start writing again. But I decided that I needed to sharpen my pencils first.</p>
<p>I have <a href="2007/09/12/entangling-the-ground-and-cloud/">plans on how publishing and sharing should work</a>. Grand plans. Too grand, perhaps.</p>
<p>So for now, I wrote something simple for myself. Now I can type away, press buttons... publish.</p>
<p>If you like Emacs, Python and Wordpress, this might be interesting to you too. If not, it certainly won't be.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gregdetre/wordpress-python-emacs">wordpress-python-emacs GitHub repository</a></p>
<p>Most of the work is being done by this great <a href="https://github.com/maxcutler/python-wordpress-xmlrpc">Python/Wordpress</a> library. Thank you.</p>
<p>I wrote some simple Python scripts. One grabs all my existing blog posts. One looks through their titles, and checks them against the filename to see if this is a new post.</p>
<p>And then there's a very simple Emacs function that calls them to save/publish the current text file.</p>
<p>I could add more things: deleting posts, or a proper workflow for moving from draft to published. Maybe later.</p>
<p>I wrote this post, then hit M-x wordpress-publish-this-file.</p>
