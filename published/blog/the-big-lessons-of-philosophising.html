      <h2>The big lessons of philosophising</h2>
    </header>
    
    <p>if you've decided that one group of intelligent people are clearly wrong, then you've probably failed to understand the full complexity of the problem  </p>
<p>some questions can't be resolved yet, or are maybe fundamentally ill-posed  </p>
<p>the devil is in the details - you can convince people with rhetoric, but if you want to be right, you have to burrow burrow burrow  </p>
<p>there's always a means of undermining your assumptions, always a meta-position that invalidates the entire debate  </p>
<p>even rational, intelligent, truth-seeking people can fail to draw the same conclusions  </p>
<p>the value of some questions doesn't lie in their answers  </p>
<p>consistency, patience, ability to withhold belief - some people don't see the attraction of methods that prioritise these  </p>
<p>given the ineliminable level of noise and ignorance attached to any real questions, philosophising can't help you decide pragmatic questions  </p>
<p>philosophising has its own aesthetics - and many of them, often exclusive to each other</p>
