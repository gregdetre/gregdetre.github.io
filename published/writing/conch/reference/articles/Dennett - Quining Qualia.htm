<i>1. Corralling the Quicksilver</i><p>

<p>

     "Qualia" is an unfamiliar term for something that could not  be more familiar to each of us: the
<i>ways things seem to us</i>. As is  so often the case with philosophical jargon, it is easier to give 
examples than to give a definition of the term. Look at  a glass  of milk at sunset; <i>the way it looks to
you</i>--the particular,  personal, subjective visual quality of the glass of milk is the  <i>quale</i> of your visual
experience at the moment. The <i>way the milk  tastes to you then</i> is another, gustatory <i>quale</i>, and <i>how
it sounds  to you</i> as you swallow is an auditory <i>quale</i>; These various  "properties of conscious
experience" are prime examples of  <i>qualia</i>. Nothing, it seems, could you know more intimately than 
your own qualia; let the entire universe be some vast illusion,  some mere figment of Descartes' evil
demon, and yet what the  figment is <i>made of</i> (for you) will be the <i>qualia</i> of your  hallucinatory
experiences. Descartes claimed to doubt everything  that could be doubted, but he never doubted that
his conscious  experiences had qualia, the properties by which he knew or  apprehended them. <p>

<p>

     The verb "to quine" is even more esoteric. It comes from <i>The  Philosophical Lexicon</i> (Dennett
1978c, 8th edn., 1987), a  satirical dictionary of eponyms: "quine, v. To deny resolutely  the existence
or importance of something real or significant." At  first blush it would be hard to imagine a more
quixotic quest  than trying to convince people that there are no such properties  as qualia; hence the
ironic title of this chapter. But I am not  kidding.<p>

<p>

     My goal is subversive.  I am out to overthrow an idea that,  in one form or another, is "obvious"
to most people--to  scientists, philosophers, lay people. My quarry is frustratingly  elusive; no sooner
does it retreat in the face of one argument  than "it" reappears, apparently innocent of all charges, in
a new  guise. <p>

     <p>

     Which idea of qualia am I trying to extirpate?  Everything  real has properties, and since I don't
deny the reality of  conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has  properties. I grant
moreover that each person's states of  consciousness have properties in virtue of which those states 
have the experiential content that they do. That is to say,  whenever someone experiences something
as being one way rather  than another, this is true in virtue of some property of  something happening
in them at the time,   but these properties  are so unlike the properties traditionally imputed to 
consciousness that it would be grossly misleading to call any of  them the long-sought qualia.  Qualia
are supposed to be <i>special</i>  properties, in some hard-to-define way. My claim--which can only  come
into focus as we proceed--is that conscious experience has  <i>no</i> properties that are special in <i>any</i> of
the ways qualia have  been supposed to be special.  <p>

<p>

     The standard reaction to this claim is the complacent  acknowledgment that while some people
may indeed have succumbed  to one confusion or fanaticism or another, one's own appeal to a 
modest, innocent notion of properties of subjective experience is  surely safe. It is just that
presumption of innocence I want to  overthrow. I want to shift the burden of proof, so that anyone 
who wants to appeal to private, subjective properties has to  prove first that in so doing they are <i>not</i>
making a mistake. This  status of <i>guilty until proven innocent</i> is neither unprecedented  nor
indefensible (so long as we restrict ourselves to concepts).   Today, no biologist would dream of
supposing that it was quite  all right to appeal to some innocent concept of <i>lan vital</i>. Of  course one
<i>could</i> use the term to mean something in good standing;  one could use <i>lan vital</i> as one's name for
DNA, for instance, but  this would be foolish nomenclature, considering the deserved  suspicion with
which the term is nowadays burdened. I want to  make it just as uncomfortable for anyone to talk of
qualia--or  "raw feels" or "phenomenal properties" or "subjective and  intrinsic properties" or "the
qualitative character" of  experience--with the standard presumption that they, and everyone  else,
knows what on earth they are talking about. <a href="#1.">Endnote 1</a><p>

<p>

       What are qualia, <i>exactly</i>? This obstreperous query is   dismissed by one author ("only half in
jest") by invoking Louis  Armstrong's legendary reply when asked what jazz was: "If you got  to ask,
you ain't never gonna get to know." (Block, 1978, p.281)  This amusing tactic perfectly illustrates
the presumption that is  my target. If I succeed in my task, this move, which passes  muster in most
circles today, will look as quaint and  insupportable as a jocular appeal to the ludicrousness of a 
living thing--a living thing, mind you!--doubting the existence  of <i>lan vital</i>.<p>

<p>

     My claim, then, is not just that the various technical or  theoretical concepts of qualia are vague
or equivocal, but that  the source concept, the "pretheoretical" notion of which the  former are
presumed to be refinements, is so thoroughly confused  that even if we undertook to salvage some
"lowest common  denominator" from the theoreticians' proposals,  any acceptable  version would
have to be so radically unlike the ill-formed  notions that are commonly appealed to that it would be
tactically  obtuse--not to say Pickwickian--to cling to the term. Far better,  tactically, to declare that
there simply are no qualia at all. <a href="#2.">Endnote 2</a>   <p>

<p>

     Rigorous arguments only work on well-defined materials, and  since my goal is to destroy our faith
in the pretheoretical or  "intuitive" concept, the right tools for my task are intuition  pumps, not
formal arguments.  What follows is a series of  fifteen intuition pumps, posed in a sequence designed
to flush  out--and then flush away--the offending intuitions. In  section 2, I will use the first two
intuition pumps to focus  attention on the traditional notion. It will be the burden of the  rest of the
paper in to convince you that these two pumps, for  all their effectiveness, mislead us and should be
discarded. In  section 3, the next four intuition pumps create and refine a  "paradox" lurking in the
tradition. This is not a formal paradox,  but only a very powerful argument pitted against some almost 
irresistibly attractive ideas. In section 4, six more intuition  pumps are arrayed in order to dissipate
the attractiveness of  those ideas, and section 5 drives this point home by showing how  hapless those
ideas prove to be when confronted with some real  cases of anomalous experience. This will leave
something of a  vacuum, and in the final section three more intuition pumps are  used to introduce
and motivate some suitable replacements for the  banished notions.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<i>2. The Special Properties of Qualia</i><p>

<p>

     <i>Intuition  pump #1: watching you eat cauliflower</i>. I see you  tucking eagerly into a helping of
steaming cauliflower, the  merest whiff of which makes me faintly nauseated, and I find  myself
wondering how you could possible relish <i>that taste</i>, and  then it occurs to me that to you, cauliflower
probably tastes  (must taste?) different.  A plausible hypothesis, it seems,  especially since I know that
the very same food often tastes  different to me at different times.  For instance, my first sip  of
breakfast orange juice tastes much sweeter than my second sip  if I interpose a bit of pancakes and
maple syrup, but after a  swallow or two of coffee, the orange juice goes back to tasting  (roughly?
exactly?) the way it did the first sip.  Surely we want  to say (or think about) such things, and surely
we are not wildly  wrong when we do, so  . . . surely it is quite OK to talk of <i>the  way the juice tastes
to Dennett at time t</i>, and ask whether it is  just the same as or different from <i>the way the juice tastes
to  Dennett at time t'</i>, or <i>the way the juice tastes to Jones at time  t</i>.  <p>

<p>

     This "conclusion" seems innocent, but right here we have  already made the big mistake. The final
step presumes that we can  isolate the qualia from everything else that is going on--at  least in
principle or for the sake of argument. What counts as  <i>the way the juice tastes to x</i> can be
distinguished, one supposes,  from what is a mere accompaniment, contributory cause, or  byproduct
of this "central" way.   One dimly imagines taking such  cases and stripping them down gradually to
the essentials,  leaving their common residuum, the way things look, sound, feel,  taste, smell to
various individuals at various times,  independently of how those individuals are stimulated or non- 
perceptually affected, and independently of how they are  subsequently disposed to behave or believe. 
The mistake is not  in supposing that we can in practice ever or always perform this  act of
purification with certainty, but the more fundamental  mistake of supposing that there is such a
residual property to  take seriously, however uncertain our actual attempts at  isolation of instances
might be.<p>

<p>

     The examples that seduce us are abundant in every modality.   I cannot imagine, will never know,
could never know, it seems,  how Bach sounded to Glenn Gould. (I can barely recover in my 
memory the way Bach sounded to me when I was a child.) And I  cannot know, it seems, what it is
like to be a bat (Nagel, 1974),  or whether you see what I see, colorwise, when we look up at a  clear
"blue" sky.  The homely cases convince us of the reality of  these special properties--those subjective
tastes, looks, aromas,  sounds--that we then apparently isolate for definition by this  philosophical
distillation. <p>

     <p>

     The specialness of these properties is hard to pin down, but  can be seen at work in <i>intuition pump
#2: the wine-tasting  machine</i>. Could Gallo Brothers replace their human wine tasters with a
machine? A computer-based  "expert system" for quality  control and classification is probably within
the bounds of  existing technology. We now know enough about the relevant  chemistry to make the
transducers that would replace taste buds  and olfactory organs (delicate color vision would perhaps
be more  problematic), and we can imagine using the output of such  transducers as the raw
material--the "sense data" in effect--for  elaborate evaluations, descriptions, classifications. Pour the 
sample in the funnel and, in a few minutes or hours, the system  would type out a chemical assay,
along with commentary: "a  flamboyant and velvety Pinot, though lacking in stamina"--or  words to
such effect. Such a machine might well perform better  than human wine tasters on all reasonable tests
of accuracy and  consistency the winemakers could devise <a href="#3.">Endnote 3</a>, but <i>surely</i> no matter  how
"sensitive" and "discriminating" such a system becomes, it  will never have, and enjoy, what <i>we</i> do
when we taste a wine: the  qualia of conscious experience! Whatever informational,  dispositional,
functional properties its internal states have,  none of them will be special in the way qualia are. If you
share  that intuition, you believe that there are qualia in the sense I  am targeting for demolition.   <p>

<p>

     What is special about qualia? Traditional analyses suggest  some fascinating second-order
properties of these properties.  First, since one <i>cannot say</i> to another, no matter how eloquent  one
is and no matter how cooperative and imaginative one's  audience is, exactly what way one is
currently seeing, tasting,  smelling and so forth, qualia are <i>ineffable</i>--in fact the paradigm  cases of
ineffable items. According to tradition, at least part  of the reason why qualia are ineffable is that they
are <i>intrinsic</i>  properties--which seems to imply <i>inter alia</i> that they are somehow  atomic and
unanalyzable.  Since they  are "simple" or  "homogeneous" there is nothing to get hold of when trying
to  describe such a property to one unacquainted with the particular  instance in question. <p>

<p>

     Moreover, verbal comparisons are not the only cross-checks  ruled out.  <i>Any</i> objective,
physiological or "merely behavioral"  test--such as those passed by the imaginary wine-tasting
system--  would of necessity miss the target (one can plausibly argue), so  all interpersonal
comparisons of these ways-of-appearing are  (apparently) systematically impossible.  In other words,
qualia  are essentially <i>private</i> properties.  And, finally, since they <i>are</i>  properties of <i>my experiences</i>
(they're not chopped liver, and  they're not properties of, say, my cerebral blood flow--or  haven't you
been paying attention?), qualia are essentially  directly accessible to the consciousness of their
experiencer  (whatever that means) or qualia are properties of one's  experience with which one is
intimately or directly acquainted  (whatever that means) or "immediate phenomenological qualities" 
(Block, 1978) (whatever that means). They are, after all, the  very properties the appreciation of
which permits us to identify  our conscious states.   So, to summarize the tradition, qualia  are
supposed to be properties of a subject's mental states that  are<p>

<p>

     (1) ineffable<p>

     (2) intrinsic<p>

     (3) private<p>

     (4) directly or immediately apprehensible in consciousness<p>

     Thus are qualia introduced onto the philosophical stage.  They have seemed to be very significant
properties to some  theorists because they have seemed to provide an insurmountable  and
unavoidable stumbling block to functionalism, or more  broadly, to materialism, or more broadly still,
to any purely  "third-person" objective viewpoint or approach to the world  (Nagel, 1986).  Theorists
of the contrary persuasion have  patiently and ingeniously knocked down all the arguments, and  said
most of the right things, but they have made a tactical  error, I am claiming, of saying in one way or
another: "We  theorists can handle <i>those qualia</i> you talk about just fine; we  will show that you are
just slightly in error about the nature of  qualia." What they ought to have said is: "What qualia?" <p>

<p>

     My challenge strikes some theorists as outrageous or  misguided because they think they have a
much blander and hence  less vulnerable notion of qualia to begin with.  They think I am  setting up
and knocking down a strawman, and ask, in effect:   "Who said qualia are ineffable, intrinsic, private,
directly  apprehensible ways things seem to one?"  Since my suggested  fourfold essence of qualia
may strike many readers as  tendentious, it may be instructive to consider, briefly, an  appparently
milder alternative: qualia are simply "the  qualitative or phenomenal features of sense experience[s],
in  virtue of having which they resemble and differ from each other,  qualitatively, in the ways they
do." (Shoemaker, 1982, p. 367)  Surely I do not mean to deny <i>those</i> features! <p>

<p>

     I reply: it all depends on what "qualitative or phenomenal"  comes to. Shoemaker contrasts
<i>qualitative</i> similarity and  difference with "intentional" similarity and difference--  similarity and
difference of the properties an experience repre sents or is "of". That is clear enough, but what then
of "pheno menal"? Among the non-intentional (and hence qualitative?)  properties of my visual states
are their physiological  properties.  Might  these very properties be the qualia Shoemaker  speaks of? 
It is supposed to be obvious, I take it, that these  sorts of features are ruled out, because they are not
"accessible  to introspection" (Shoemaker, private correspondence).  These are  features of my visual
<i>state</i>, perhaps, but not of my visual  <i>experience</i>. They are not <i>phenomenal</i> properties. <p>

<p>

     But then  another non-intentional similarity some of my  visual states share is that they tend to
make me think about  going to bed.  I think this feature of them <i>is</i> accessible to  introspection--on
any ordinary, pre-theoretical construal. Is  that a phenomenal property or not?   The term
"phenomenal" means  nothing obvious and untendentious to me, and looks suspiciously  like a gesture
in the direction leading back to ineffable,  private, directly apprehensible ways things seem to one.
<a href="#4.">Endnote 4</a> <p>

     I suspect, in fact,  that many are unwilling to take my  radical challenge seriously largely because
they want so much for  qualia to be acknowledged.  Qualia seem to many people to be the  last ditch
defense of the inwardness and elusiveness of our  minds, a bulwark against creeping mechanism. 
They are sure there  must be <i>some</i> sound path from the homely cases to the redoubtable  category
of the philosophers, since otherwise their last bastion  of specialness will be stormed by science. <p>

<p>

     This special status for these presumed properties has a long  and eminent tradition. I believe it was
Einstein who once advised  us that science could not give us the <i>taste</i> of the soup.  Could  such a wise
man have been wrong? Yes, if he is taken to have been  trying to remind us of the qualia that hide
forever from  objective science in the subjective inner sancta of our minds.   There are no such things. 
Another wise man said so--Wittgenstein  (1958, esp.pp.91-100). Actually, what he said was:<p>

<blockquote>
          The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a
<i>something</i>; for the box might even be empty. --No, one can 'divide through' by the thing
in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is. (p.100)
</blockquote>
<p>

and then he went on to hedge his bets by saying "It is not a  <i>something</i>, but not a <i>nothing</i> either!  The
conclusion was only  that a nothing would serve just as well as a something about  which nothing
could be said." (p.102)  Both Einstein's and  Wittgenstein's remarks are endlessly amenable to
exegesis, but  rather than undertaking to referee this War of the Titans, I  choose to take what may
well be a more radical stand than  Wittgenstein's. <a href="#5.">Endnote 5</a>  Qualia are not even "something about
which  nothing can be said"; "qualia" is a philosophers' term which  fosters <a href="#6.">Endnote 6</a> nothing but
confusion, and refers in the end to no  properties or features at all. <p>

<p>

<i>3. The Traditional Paradox Regained</i><p>

<p>

     Qualia have not always been in good odor among philosophers.      Although many have thought,
along with Descartes and Locke, that  it made sense to talk about private, ineffable properties of 
minds, others have argued that this is strictly nonsense--however  naturally it trips off the tongue. It
is worth recalling how  qualia were presumably rehabilitated as properties to be taken  seriously in
the wake of Wittgensteinian and verificationist  attacks on them as pseudo-hypotheses. The original
version of  <i>intuition pump #3: the inverted spectrum</i> (Locke, 1690: II, xxxii,  15) is a speculation
about two people: how do I know that you and  I see the same subjective color when we look at
something? Since  we both learned color words by being shown public colored  objects, our verbal
behavior will match <i>even if we experience  entirely different subjective colors</i>. The intuition that this 
hypothesis is systematically unconfirmable (and undisconfirmable,  of course) has always been quite
robust, but some people have  always been tempted to think technology could (in principle)  bridge
the gap. <p>

<p>

     Suppose, in <i>intuition pump #4: the Brainstorm machine</i>, there  were some neuroscientific
apparatus that fits on your head and  feeds your visual experience into my brain (as in the movie, 
<i>Brainstorm</i>, which is not to be confused with the book,  <i>Brainstorms</i>). With eyes closed I accurately
report everything you  are looking at, except that I marvel at how the sky is yellow,  the grass red,
and so forth. Would this not confirm, empirically,  that our qualia were different? But suppose the
technician then  pulls the plug on the connecting cable, inverts it 180 degrees  and reinserts it in the
socket. Now I report the sky is blue, the  grass green, and so forth. Which is the "right" orientation
of  the plug? Designing and building such a device would require that  its "fidelity" be tuned or
calibrated by the normalization of the  two subjects' reports--so we would be right back at our eviden
tial starting point. The moral of this intuition pump is that no  intersubjective comparison of qualia
is possible, even with  perfect technology. <p>

<p>

     So matters stood until someone dreamt up the presumably  improved version of the thought
experiment: the <i>intra</i>-personal  inverted spectrum. The idea seems to have occurred to several  people
independently (Gert, 1965, Putnam, 1965, Tayler, 1966,  Shoemaker, 1969, 1975, Lycan, 1973).
Probably Block and Fodor  (1972) have it in mind when they say "It seems to us that the  standard
verificationist counterarguments against the view that  the 'inverted spectrum' hypothesis is
conceptually incoherent are  not persuasive." (p.172.) In this version, <i>intuition pump #5: the 
neurosurgical prank</i>,  the experiences to be compared are all in  one mind. You wake up one morning
to find that the grass has  turned red, the sky yellow, and so forth. No one else notices any  color
anomalies in the world, so the problem must be in you. You  are entitled, it seems, to conclude that
you have undergone  visual color qualia inversion (and we later discover, if you  like, just how the
evil neurophysiologists tampered with your  neurons to accomplish this).  <p>

<p>

     Here it seems at first--and indeed for quite a while--that  qualia are acceptable properties after all,
because propositions  about them can be justifiably asserted, empirically verified and  even explained. 
After all, in the imagined case, we can tell a  tale in which we confirm a detailed neurophysiological
account of  the precise etiology of the dramatic change you undergo.  It is  tempting to suppose, then, 
that neurophysiological evidence,  incorporated into a robust and ramifying theory, would have all 
the resolving power we could ever need for determining whether or  not someone's qualia have
actually shifted. <p>

<p>

     But this is a mistake. It will take some patient exploration  to reveal the mistake in depth, but the
conclusion can be reached  --if not secured--quickly with the help of <i>intuition pump #6:  alternative
neurosurgery</i>.  There are (at least) two different  ways the evil neurosurgeon might create the
inversion effect  described in intuition pump #5: <p>

<p>

     (I) Invert one of the "early" qualia-producing channels, e.g., in the optic nerve, so that all relevant
neural events "downstream" are the "opposite" of their original and normal values. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> this
inverts your qualia.<p>

<p>

     (II)  Leave all those early pathways intact and simply invert certain memory-access links--whatever
it is that accomplishes your tacit (and even unconscious!) comparison of today's hues with those of
yore. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> this does <i>not</i> invert your qualia at all, but just your memory-anchored dispositions
to react to them. <p>

<p>

     On waking up and finding your visual world highly anomalous,  you should exclaim "Egad!
<i>Something</i> has happened! Either my  qualia have been inverted or my memory-linked  qualia-reactions 
have been inverted. I wonder which!" <p>

<p>

       The intrapersonal inverted spectrum thought experiment was  widely supposed to be an
improvement, since it moved the needed  comparison into one subject's head. But now we can see
that this  is an illusion, since the link to earlier experiences, the link  via memory, is analogous to the
imaginary cable that might link  two subjects in the original version.<p>

<p>

     This point is routinely--one might say traditionally--missed  by the constructors of "intrasubjective
inverted spectrum"  thought experiments,  who suppose that the subject's <i>noticing the 
difference</i>--surely a vivid experience of discovery by the  subject--would have to be an instance of
(directly?  incorrigibly?) recognizing the difference <i>as a shift in qualia</i>.  But as my example shows,
we could achieve the same startling  effect  in a subject without tampering with his presumed qualia 
at all.    Since <i>ex hypothesi</i> the two different surgical  invasions can produce exactly the same
introspective effects  while only one operation inverts the qualia, nothing in the  subject's experience
can favor one of the hypotheses over the  other. So unless he seeks outside help, the state of his own 
qualia must be as unknowable to him as the state of anyone else's  qualia. Hardly the privileged access
or immediate acquaintance or  direct apprehension the friends of qualia had supposed  "phenomenal
features" to enjoy!<p>

<p>

     The outcome of this series of thought experiments is an  intensification of the "verificationist"
argument against qualia.  <i>If</i> there are qualia, they are even less accessible to our ken  than we had
thought. Not only are the classical intersubjective  comparisons impossible (as the Brainstorm
machine shows), but we  cannot tell in our own cases whether our qualia have been  inverted--at least
not by introspection. It is surely tempting at  this point--especially to non-philosophers--to decide that
this  paradoxical result must be an artifact of some philosophical  misanalysis or other, the sort of
thing that might well happen if  you took a perfectly good pre-theoretical notion--our everyday 
notion of qualia--and illicitly stretched it beyond the breaking  point. The philosophers have made a
mess; let them clean it up;  meanwhile we others can get back to work, relying as always on  our
sober and unmetaphysical acquaintance with qualia. <p>

<p>

     Overcoming this ubiquitous temptation is the task of the  next section, which will seek to establish
the unsalvageable  incoherence of the hunches that lead to the paradox by looking  more closely at
their sources and their motivation.  <p>

<p>

<i>4. Making Mistakes About Qualia</i><p>

<p>

     The idea that people might be mistaken about their own  qualia is at the heart of the ongoing
confusion, and must be  explored in more detail, and with somewhat more realistic  examples,  if we
are to see the delicate role it plays. <p>

<p>

     <i>Intuition pump #7: Chase and Sanborn</i>.  Once upon a time  there were two coffee tasters, Mr.
Chase and Mr. Sanborn, who  worked for Maxwell House <a href="#7.">Endnote 7</a> Along with half a dozen other
coffee  tasters, their job was to ensure that the taste of Maxwell House  stayed constant, year after
year.  One day, about six years after  Mr. Chase had come to work for Maxwell House, he confessed
to Mr.  Sanborn:<p>

<p>

   I hate to admit it, but I'm not enjoying this work anymore.  When I came to Maxwell House six
years ago, I thought Maxwell House coffee was the best-tasting coffee in the world.  I was proud to
have a share in the responsibility for preserving that flavor over the years.  And we've done our job
well; the coffee tastes just the same today as it tasted when I arrived.  But, you know, I no longer like
it! My tastes have changed.  I've become a more sophisticated coffee drinker.  I no longer like <i>that
taste</i> at  all.  <p>

<p>

Sanborn greeted this revelation with considerable interest. "It's  funny you should mention it, " he
replied, "for something rather  similar has happened to me."  He went on:<p>

      <p>

   When I arrived here, shortly before you did, I, like you, thought Maxwell House coffee was tops
in flavor.  And now I, like you, really don't care for the coffee we're making.  But <i>my</i> tastes haven't
changed; my . . .<i>tasters</i> have changed.  That is, I think something has gone wrong with my taste buds
or some other part of my taste-analyzing perceptual machinery.  Maxwell House coffee doesn't taste
to me the way it used to taste; if only it did, I'd still love it, for I still think <i>that taste</i>  is the best taste
in coffee.  Now I'm not saying we haven't done our job well.  You other tasters all agree that the taste
is the same, and I must admit that on a day-to-day basis I can detect no change either. So it must be
my problem alone.  I guess I'm no longer cut out for this work. <p>

<p>

     Chase and Sanborn are alike in one way at least: they both  used to like Maxwell House coffee,
and now neither likes it.  But  they claim to be different in another way.  Maxwell House tastes  to
Chase just the way it always did, but not so for Sanborn.  But  can we take their protestations at face
value?  Must we?    Might  one or both of them simply be wrong?  Might their predicaments be 
importantly the same and their apparent disagreement more a  difference in manner of expression than
in experiential or psy chological state?  Since both of them make claims that depend on  the reliability
of their memories, is there any way to check on  this reliability?<p>

<p>

     My reason for introducing two characters in the example is  not to set up an interpersonal
comparison between how the coffee  tastes to Chase and how it tastes to Sanborn, but just to  exhibit,
side-by-side, two poles between which cases of intraper sonal experiential shift can wander.  Such
cases of intrapersonal  experiential shift, and the possibility of adaptation to them, or  interference
with memory in  them, have often been discussed in  the literature on qualia, but without sufficient
attention to the  details, in my opinion.  Let us look at Chase first.  Falling in  for the nonce with the
received manner of speaking, it appears at  first that there are the following possibilities:<p>

<p>

     (a) Chase's coffee-taste-qualia have stayed constant, while his reactive attitudes to those qualia,
devolving on his canons of aesthetic judgment, etc., have shifted--which is what he seems, in his
informal, casual way, to be asserting.<p>

<p>

     (b) Chase is simply wrong about the constancy of his qualia; they have shifted gradually and
imperceptibly over the years, while his standards of taste haven't budged--in spite of his delusions
about having become more sophisticated.  He is in the state Sanborn claims to be in, but just lacks
Sanborn's self-knowledge.<p>

<p>

    (c) Chase is in some predicament intermediate between (a) and (b); his qualia have shifted some
<i>and</i> his standards of judgment have also slipped.<p>

<p>

Sanborn's case seems amenable to three counterpart versions: <p>

<p>

     (a) Sanborn is right; his qualia have shifted, due to some sort of derangement in his perceptual
machinery, but his standards have indeed remained constant.<p>

<p>

    (b) Sanborn's standards have shifted unbeknownst to him. He is thus misremembering his past
experiences, in what we might call a nostalgia effect.   Think of the familiar experience of returning
to some object from your childhood (a classroom desk, a tree-house) and finding it much smaller than
you remember it to have been.  Presumably as you grew larger your internal standard for what was
large grew with you somehow, but your memories (which are stored as fractions or multiples of that
standard) didn't compensate, and hence when you consult your memory, it returns a distorted
judgment. Sanborn's nostalgia-tinged memory of good old Maxwell House is similarly distorted.
(There are obviously many different ways this impressionistic sketch of a memory mechanism could
be implemented, and there is considerable experimental work in cognitive psychology that suggests
how different hypotheses about such mechanisms could be tested.)<p>

<p>

     (c) As before, Sanborn's state is some combination of (a) and (b). <p>

<p>

     I think that everyone writing about qualia today would agree  that there are all these possibilities
for Chase and Sanborn.   I know of no one these days who is  tempted to defend the high  line on
infallibility or incorrigibility that would declare that  alternative (a) is--and must be--the truth in each
case, since  people just cannot be wrong about such private, subjective  matters. <a href="#8.">Endnote 8</a> <p>

<p>

     Since quandaries are about to arise, however, it might be  wise to review in outline why the
attractiveness of the  infallibilist position is only superficial, so it won't recover  its erstwhile allure
when the going gets tough. First, in the  wake of Wittgenstein (1958) and Malcolm (1956, 1959) we
have seen  that one way to buy such infallibility is to acquiesce in the  complete evaporation of
content (Dennett, 1976)."Imagine someone  saying: 'But I know how tall I am!' and laying his hand
on top of  his head to prove it." (Wittgenstein, 1958, p.96)  By diminishing  one's claim until there
is nothing left to be right or wrong  about, one can achieve a certain empty invincibility, but that  will
not do in this case.  One of the things we want Chase to be  right about (if he is right) is that he is not
in Sanborn's  predicament, so if the claim is to be viewed as infallible, it  can hardly be because it
declines to assert anything. <p>

<p>

     There is a strong temptation, I have found, to respond to my  claims in this paper more or less as
follows: "But after all is  said and done, there is still something I know in a special way:  I know <i>how
it is with me right now</i>."  But if absolutely nothing  follows from this presumed knowledge--nothing,
for instance, that  would shed any light on the different psychological claims that  might be true of
Chase or Sanborn--what is the point of asserting  that one has it?  Perhaps people just want to
reaffirm their  sense of proprietorship over their own conscious states.<p>

<p>

     The infallibilist line on qualia treats them as properties  of one's experience one cannot in principle
misdiscover, and this  is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infal libility) unless we
shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia  as <i>logical constructs</i> out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a
sub ject's experience has the quale <i>F</i> if and only if the subject  judges his experience to have quale <i>F</i>.
We can then treat such  judgings as constitutive acts, in effect, bringing the quale into  existence by
the same sort of license as novelists have to deter mine the hair color of their characters by fiat. We
do not ask  how Dostoevski knows that Raskolnikov's hair is light brown. <p>

<p>

     There is a limited use for such interpretations of subjects'  protocols, I have argued (Dennett
1978a; 1979, esp., pp.109-110;  1982), but they will not help the defenders of qualia here.   Logical
constructs out of judgments must be viewed as akin to  theorists' fictions, and the friends of qualia
want the existence   of a particular quale in any particular case to be an empirical  fact in good
standing, not a theorist's useful interpretive  fiction, else it will not loom as a challenge to
functionalism or  materialism or third-person, objective science.  <p>

<p>

     It seems easy enough, then, to dream up empirical tests that  would tend to confirm Chase and
Sanborn's different tales, but if  passing such tests could support their authority (that is to say,  their
reliability), failing the tests would have to undermine it.   The price you pay for the possibility of
empirically confirming  your assertions is the outside chance of being discredited.  The  friends of
qualia are prepared, today, to pay that price, but  perhaps only because they haven't reckoned how
the bargain they  have struck will subvert the concept they want to defend.<p>

<p>

     Consider how we could shed light on the question of where  the truth lies in the particular cases
of Chase and Sanborn, even  if we might not be able to settle the matter definitively. It is  obvious that
there might be telling objective support for one  extreme version or another of their stories.  Thus if
Chase is  unable to reidentify coffees, teas, and wines in blind tastings  in which only minutes
intervene between first and second sips,  his claim to <i>know</i> that Maxwell House tastes just the same
to him  now as it did six years ago will be seriously undercut.  Alterna tively, if he does excellently
in blind tastings, and exhibits  considerable knowledge about the canons of coffee style (if such  there
be), his claim to have become a more sophisticated taster  will be supported.  Exploitation of the
standard principles of  inductive testing--basically Mill's method of differences--can go  a long way
toward indicating what sort of change has occurred in  Chase or Sanborn--a change near the brute
perceptual processing  end of the spectrum or a change near the ultimate reactive judg ment end of
the spectrum. And as Shoemaker (1982) and others have  noted, physiological measures, suitably
interpreted in some  larger theoretical framework, could also weight the scales in  favor of one
extreme or the other. For instance, the well-studied  phenomenon of induced illusory boundaries (see
Figure 1) has <p>

<img src="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/graphics/quinfig1.gif"><p>

<center>INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE</center>
<p>

<p>

often been claimed to be a particularly "cognitive" illusion,  dependent on "top down" processes, and
hence, presumably, near  the reactive judgment end of the spectrum, but recent  experimental work
(Von der Heydt et al., 1984) has revealed that  "edge detector" neurons <i>relatively</i> low in the visual
pathways--in  area 18 of the visual cortex--are as responsive to illusory edges  as to real light-dark
boundaries on the retina, suggesting (but  not quite proving, since these might somehow still be
"descending  effects") that illusory contours are not imposed from on high,  but generated quite early
in visual processing.  One can imagine  discovering a similarly "early" anomaly in the pathways
leading  from taste buds to judgment in Sanborn, for instance, tending to  confirm his claim that he
has suffered some change in his basic  perceptual--as opposed to judgmental--machinery. <p>

<p>

     But let us not overestimate the resolving power of such  empirical testing. The space between the
two poles represented by  possibility (a) and possibility (b) would be occupied by  phenomena that
were the product, somehow, of two factors in  varying proportion: roughly, dispositions to generate
or produce  qualia and dispositions to react to the qualia once they are  produced. (That is how our
intuitive picture of qualia would  envisage it.) Qualia are supposed to affect our action or beha vior
only via the intermediary of our judgments about them, so  any behavioral test, such as a
discrimination or memory test,  since it takes acts based on judgments as its primary data, can  give
us direct evidence only about the <i>resultant</i> of our two  factors. In extreme cases we can have indirect
evidence to sug gest that one factor has varied a great deal, the other factor  hardly at all, and we can
test the hypothesis further by checking  the relative sensitivity of the subject to variations in the 
conditions that presumably alter the two component factors.  But  such indirect testing cannot be
expected to  resolve the issue  when the effects are relatively small--when, for instance, our  rival
hypotheses are Chase's preferred hypothesis (a) and the  minor variant to the effect that his qualia
have shifted <i>a little</i>  and his standards <i>less than he thinks</i>. This will be true even  when we include
in our data any unintended or unconscious beha vioral effects, for their import will be ambiguous.
(Would a  longer response latency in Chase today be indicative of a process  of "attempted qualia
renormalization" or "extended aesthetic  evaluation"?) <p>

<p>

     The limited evidential power of neurophysiology comes out  particularly clearly if we imagine a
case of adaptation. Suppose,  in <i>intuition pump #8: the gradual post-operative recovery</i>, that  we
have somehow "surgically inverted" Chase's taste bud  connections in the standard imaginary way:
post-operatively,  sugar tastes salty, salt tastes sour, etc. But suppose further--  and this is as realistic
a supposition as its denial--that Chase  has subsequently compensated--as revealed by his behavior.
He now  <i>says</i> that the sugary substance we place on his tongue is sweet,  and no longer favors gravy
on his ice cream. Let us suppose the  compensation is so thorough that  on all behavioral and verbal 
tests his performance is indistinguishable from that of normal  subjects--and from his own pre-surgical
performance.<p>

<p>

     If all the internal compensatory adjustment has been  accomplished early in the process--intuitively,
pre-qualia--then  his qualia today are restored to just as they were (relative to  external sources of
stimulation) before the surgery. If on the  other hand some or all of the internal compensatory
adjustment is  post-qualia, then his qualia have not been renormalized <i>even if  he thinks they have</i>.
But the physiological facts will not in  themselves shed any light on where in the stream of
physiological  process twixt tasting and telling to draw the line at which the  putative qualia appear
as properties of that phase of the  process. The qualia are the "immediate or phenomenal" properties, 
of course, but this description will not serve to locate the  right phase in the physiological stream, for,
echoing intuition  pump #6, there will always be at least two possible ways of  interpreting the
neurophysiological theory, however it comes out.       Suppose our physiological theory tells us (in
as much detail as  you like) that the compensatory effect in him has been achieved  by an <i>adjustment
in the memory-accessing process</i> that is required  for our victim to compare today's hues to those of
yore. There  are  <i>still</i> two stories that might be told: <p>

<p>

     (I) Chase's current qualia are still abnormal, but thanks to the revision in his memory-accessing
process, he has in effect adjusted his memories of how things used to taste, so he no longer notices
any anomaly.<p>

<p>

     (II) The memory-comparison step occurs just prior to the qualia phase in taste perception; thanks
to the revision, it now <i>yields</i> the same old qualia for the same stimulation.<p>

<p>

     In (I) the qualia contribute to the input, in effect, to the  memory-comparator. In (II) they are part
of the output of the  memory-comparator. These seem to be two substantially different  hypotheses,
but the physiological evidence, no matter how well  developed, will not tell us on which side of
memory to put the  qualia. Chase's introspective evidence will not settle the issue  between (I) and
(II) either, since <i>ex hypothesi</i> those stories are  not reliably distinguishable by him.  Remember that
it was  in order to confirm or disconfirm Chase's opinion that we turned  to the neurophysiological
evidence in the first place. We can  hardly use his opinion in the end to settle the matter between  our
rival neurophysiological theories. Chase may think that he  thinks his experiences are the same as
before <i>because</i> they really  are (and he remembers accurately how it used to be), but he must  admit
that he has no introspective resources for distinguishing  that possibility from alternative (I), on which
he thinks things  are as they used to be <i>because</i> his memory of how they used to be  has been
distorted by his new compensatory habits.<p>

<p>

      Faced with their subject's systematic neutrality, the  physiologists may have their own reasons for
preferring (I) to  (II) or vice versa, for they may have <i>appropriated</i> the term  "qualia" to their own
theoretical ends, to denote some family of  detectable properties that strike them as playing an
important  role in their neurophysiological theory of perceptual recognition  and memory.  Chase or
Sanborn might complain--in the company of  more than a few philosophical spokesmen--that these
properties  the neurophsyiologists choose to call "qualia" are not the qualia  they are speaking of. The
scientists' retort is: "If we cannot  distinguish (I) from (II), we certainly cannot support either of  your
claims. If you want our support, you must relinquish your  concept of qualia."  <p>

<p>

    What is striking about this is not just that the empirical  methods would fall short of distinguishing
what seem to be such  different claims about qualia, but that they would fall short <i>in  spite of being
better evidence than the subject's own introspec tive convictions</i>.  For the subject's own judgments,
like the  behaviors or actions that express them, are the resultant of our  two postulated factors, and
cannot discern the component propor tions any better than external behavioral tests can. Indeed, a 
subject's "introspective" convictions will generally be <i>worse</i>  evidence than what outside observers
can gather. For if our  subject is--as most are--a "naive subject", unacquainted with  statistical data
about his own case or similar cases, his imme diate, frank judgments are, evidentially, like any naive 
observer's perceptual judgments about factors in the outside  world.  Chase's intuitive judgments
about his qualia constancy  are no better off, epistemically, than his intuitive judgments  about, say,
lighting intensity constancy or room temperature  constancy--or his own body temperature constancy. 
Moving to a  condition inside his body does not change the intimacy of the  epistemic relation in any
special way. Is Chase running a fever  or just feeling feverish? Unless he has taken steps to calibrate 
and cross-check his own performance, his opinion that his fever-  perception apparatus is undisturbed
is no better than a hunch.  Similarly, Chase may have a strongly held opinion about the  degree to
which his taste-perceiving apparatus has maintained its  integrity, and the degree to which his
judgment has evolved  through sophistication, but pending the results of the sort of  laborious
third-person testing just imagined, he would be a fool  to claim to know--especially to know directly
or immediately--  that his was a pure case (a), closer to (a) than to (b), or a  case near (b). <p>

<p>

     He is on quite firm ground, epistemically, when he reports  that <i>the relation</i> between his
coffee-sipping activity and his  judging activity has changed.  Recall that this is the factor  that Chase
and Sanborn have in common: they used to like Maxwell  House; now they don't.  But unless he
carries out on himself the  sorts of tests others might carry out on him, his convictions  about what
has stayed constant (or nearly so) and what has  shifted <i>must be sheer guessing</i>.<p>

<p>

     But then qualia--supposing for the time being that we know  what we are talking about--must lose
one of their "essential"  second-order properties: far from being directly or immediately  apprehensible
properties of our experience, they are properties  whose changes or constancies are either entirely
beyond our ken,  or inferrable (at best) from "third-person" examinations of our  behavioral and
physiological reaction patterns (if Chase and  Sanborn acquiesce in the neurophysiologists' sense of
the term).  On this view, Chase and Sanborn should be viewed not as  introspectors capable of a
privileged view of these properties,  but as autopsychologists, theorists whose convictions about the 
properties of their own nervous systems are based not only on  their "immediate" or current
experiential convictions, but also  on their appreciation of the import of events they remember from 
the recent past. <p>

<p>

     There are, as we shall see, good reasons for neurophysiologists  and other "objective,
third-person" theorists to single out such a  class of properties to study. But they are not qualia, for
the  simple reason that one's epistemic relation to them is <i>exactly</i>  the same as one's epistemic relation
to such external, but  readily--if fallibly--detectable, properties as room temperature  or weight.   The
idea that one should consult an outside expert,  and perform elaborate behavioral tests on oneself in
order to  confirm what qualia one had, surely takes us too far away from  our original idea of qualia
as properties with which we have a  particularly intimate acquaintance.<p>

<p>

     So perhaps we have taken a wrong turning.  The doctrine that  led to this embarrassing result was
the doctrine that sharply  distinguished qualia from their (normal) effects on reactions.   Consider
Chase again. He claims that coffee tastes "just the  same" as it always did, but he admits--nay
insists--that his  reaction to "that taste" is not what it used to be.  That is, he  pretends to be able to
divorce his apprehension (or recollection)  of the quale--the taste, in ordinary parlance--from his
different  reactions to the taste.  But this apprehension or recollection is  itself a reaction to the
presumed quale, so some sleight-of-hand  is being perpetrated--innocently no doubt--by Chase.  So
suppose  instead that Chase had insisted that precisely <i>because</i> his reac tion was now different, the
taste had changed for him.  (When he  told his wife his original tale, she said "Don't be silly! Once 
you add the dislike you change the experience!"--and the more he  thought about it, the more he
decided she was right.)<p>

     <p>

     <i>Intuition pump #9: the experienced beer drinker</i>. It is  familiarly said that beer, for example, is
an acquired taste; one  gradually trains oneself--or just comes--to enjoy that flavor.   What flavor? 
The flavor of the first sip? No one could like <i>that</i>  flavor, an experienced beer drinker might retort: 
     <p>

<p>

     Beer tastes different to the experienced beer drinker.  If beer went on tasting to me the way the
first sip tasted, I would never have gone on drinking beer!  Or to put the same point the other way
around, if my first sip of beer had tasted to me the way my most recent sip just tasted, I would never
have had to acquire the taste in the first place! I would have loved the first sip as much as the one I
just enjoyed. <p>

<p>

     If we let this speech pass, we must admit that beer is <i>not</i>  an acquired taste. No one comes to
enjoy <i>the way the first sip  tasted</i>. Instead, prolonged beer drinking leads people to  experience a taste
they enjoy, but precisely their enjoying the  taste guarantees that it is not the taste they first 
experienced. <a href="#9.">Endnote 9</a><p>

<p>

     But this conclusion, if it is accepted, wreaks havoc of a  different sort with the traditional
philosophical view of qualia.   For if it is admitted that one's attitudes towards, or reactions  to,
experiences are in any way and in any degree constitutive of  their experiential qualities, so that a
change in reactivity  <i>amounts to</i> or <i>guarantees</i> a change in the property, then those  properties, those
"qualitative or phenomenal features," cease to  be "intrinsic" properties, and in fact become
paradigmatically  extrinsic, relational properties.<p>

<p>

     Properties that "seem intrinsic" at first often turn out on  more careful analysis to be relational.
Bennett (1965) is the  author of <i>intuition pump #10: the world-wide eugenics experiment</i>.   He draws
our attention to phenol-thio-urea., a substance which  tastes very bitter to three-fourths of humanity,
and as tasteless  as water to the rest. Is it bitter? Since the reactivity to  phenol-thio-urea is genetically
transmitted, we could make it  paradigmatically bitter by performing a large-scale breeding 
experiment: prevent the people to whom it is tasteless from  breeding, and in a few generations phenol
would be as bitter as  anything to be found in the world. But we could also (in  principle!) perform
the contrary feat of mass "eugenics" and  thereby make phenol paradigmatically tasteless--as tasteless
as  water--without ever touching phenol. Clearly, public bitterness  or tastelessness is not an intrinsic
property of phenol-thio-urea  but a relational property, since the property is changed by a  change in
the reference class of normal detectors.  <p>

<p>

     The public versions of perceptual "qualia" all <i>seem</i>  intrinsic, in spite of their relationality. They
are not alone.  Think of the "felt value" of a dollar (or whatever your native  currency is). "How much
is that in <i>real</i> money?" the American  tourist is reputed to have asked, hoping to translate a foreign 
price onto the scale of "intrinsic value" he keeps in his head.  As Elster (1985) claims  "there is a
tendency to overlook the  implicitly relational character of certain monadic predicates."   Walzer
(1985) points out that ". . . a ten-dollar bill might seem  to have a life of its own as a thing of value,
but, as Elster  suggests, its value implicitly depends on 'other people who are  prepared to accept
money as payment for goods.'" But even as one  concedes this, there is still a tendency to reserve
something  subjective, felt value, as an "intrinsic" property of that ten-  dollar bill. But as we now see,
such intrinsic properties cannot  be properties to which a subject's access is in any way  privileged. <p>

<p>

     Which way should Chase go? Should he take his wife's advice  and declare that since he can't stand
the coffee anymore, it no  longer tastes the same to him (it used to taste good and now it  tastes bad)? 
Or should he say that really, in a certain sense,  it does taste the way it always did, or at least it sort
of  does--when you subtract the fact that it tastes so bad now, of  course?  <p>

<p>

     We have now reached the heart of my case. The fact is that  we have to ask Chase which way he
wants to go, and there really  are two drastically different alternatives available to him <i>if we  force the
issue</i>. Which way would <i>you</i> go? Which concept of qualia  did you "always have in the back of your
mind," guiding your  imagination as you thought about theories? If you acknowledge  that the answer
is not obvious, and especially if you complain  that this forced choice drives apart two aspects that
you had  supposed united in your pretheoretic concept, you support my  contention that there is no
secure foundation in ordinary "folk  psychology" for a concept of qualia. We <i>normally</i> think in a 
confused and potentially incoherent way when we think about the  ways things seem to us.  <p>

<p>

     When Chase thinks of "that taste" he thinks equivocally or  vaguely.  He harkens back in memory
to earlier experiences but  need not try--or be able--to settle whether he is including any  or all of his
reactions or excluding them from what he intends by  "that taste".  His state then and his state now
are different--  <i>that</i> he can avow with confidence--but he has no "immediate"  resources for making
a finer distinction, nor any need to do  so. <a href="#10.">Endnote 10</a><p>

<p>

     This suggests that qualia are no more essential to the  professional vocabulary of the
phenomenologist (or professional  coffee taster) than to the vocabulary of the physiologist (Den nett,
1978b). To see this, consider again the example of my  dislike of cauliflower. Imagine now, in
<i>intuition pump #11: the  cauliflower cure</i>, that someone offers me a pill to  cure my loathing for
cauliflower. He promises that after I  swallow this pill cauliflower will taste exactly the same to me 
as it always has, but I will like that taste!  "Hang on," I might  reply. "I think you may have just
contradicted yourself." But in  any event I take the pill and it works. I become an instant 
cauliflower-appreciater, but if I am asked which of the two  possible effects  (Chase-type or
Sanborn-type) the pill has had  on me, I will be puzzled, and will find nothing <i>in my experience</i>  to
shed light on the question.  Of course I recognize that the  taste is (sort of) the same--the pill hasn't
made cauliflower  taste like chocolate cake, after all--but at the same time my  experience is so
different now that I resist saying that cauli flower tastes the way it used to taste.  There is in any event
no  reason to be cowed into supposing that my cauliflower experiences  have some intrinsic properties
behind, or in addition to, their  various dispositional, reaction-provoking properties.   <p>

<p>

     "But in principle there has to be a right answer to the  question of how it is, intrinsically, with you
now, even if you  are unable to say with any confidence!"  Why?  Would one say the  same about all
other properties of experience?  Consider  <i>intuition pump #12: visual field inversion created by
wearing  inverting spectacles</i>, a phenomenon which has been empirically  studied for years. (G. M.
Stratton published the pioneering work  in 1896, and J. J. Gibson and Ivo Kohler were among the
principal  investigators. For an introductory account, see Gregory, 1977.)   After wearing inverting
spectacles for several days subjects make  an astonishingly successful adaptation.  Suppose we
pressed on  them this question: "Does your adaptation consist in your re-  inverting your visual field,
or in your turning the rest of your  mind upside-down in a host of compensations?"  If they demur,
may  we insist that there has to be a right answer, even if they  cannot say with any confidence which
it is?  Such an insistence  would lead directly to a new version of the old inverted spectrum  thought
experiment: "How do I know whether some people see things  upside-down (but are perfectly used
to it), while others see  things right-side-up?" <p>

<p>

     Only a very naive view of visual perception could sustain  the idea that one's visual field has a
property of right-side-  upness or upside-downness <i>independent of one's dispositions to  react to
it</i>--"intrinsic right-side-upness" we could call it. (See  my discussion of the properties of the "images"
processed by the  robot, SHAKEY, in Dennett, 1982.) So not all properties of con scious experience
invite or require treatment as "intrinsic"  properties. Is there something distinguishing about a certain 
subclass of properties (the " qualitative or phenomenal" sub class, presumably) that forces us to treat
them--unlike subjec tive right-side-upness--as intrinsic properties?  If not, such  properties have no
role to play, in either physiological theories  of experience, or in introspective theories.   <p>

<p>

     Some may be inclined to argue this way: I can definitely  imagine the experience of "spectrum
inversion" from the inside;  after all, I have actually experienced temporary effects of the  same type,
such as the "taste displacement" effect of the maple  syrup on the orange juice. What is imaginable,
or actual, is  possible. Therefore spectrum inversion or displacement (in all  sensory modalities) is
possible. But such phenomena just <i>are</i> the  inversion or displacement of qualia, or intrinsic subjective 
properties. Therefore there must be qualia: intrinsic subjective  properties.<p>

<p>

     This is fallacious. What one imagines and what one says one  imagines may be two different
things. To imagine visual field  inversion, of the sort Stratton and Kohler's subjects  experienced, is
not necessarily to imagine the absolute inversion  of a visual field (even if that is what it "feels like"
to the  subjects). Less obviously, imagining--as vividly as you like--a  case of subjective
color-perception displacement is not  necessarily imagining what that phenomenon is typically called
by  philosophers: an inverted or displaced spectrum <i>of qualia</i>.  Insofar as that term carries the
problematic implications scouted  here, there is no support for its use arising simply from the 
vividness or naturalness of the imagined possibility. <p>

<p>

     If there are no such properties as qualia, does that mean  that "spectrum inversion" is impossible? 
Yes and no. Spectrum  inversion as classically debated is impossible, but something  like it is perfectly
possible--something that is as like "qualia  inversion" as visual field inversion is like the impossible 
<i>absolute</i> visual image inversion we just dismissed. <p>

<p>

<i>5. Some Puzzling Real Cases</i><p>

<p>

<p>

     It is not enough to withhold our theoretical allegiances  until the sunny day when the philosophers
complete the tricky  task of purifying the everyday concept of qualia. Unless we take  active steps to
shed this source concept, and replace it with  better ideas, it will continue to cripple our imaginations
and  systematically distort our attempts to understand the phenomena  already encountered. <p>

<p>

     What we find, if we look at the actual phenomena of  anomalies of color perception, for instance,
amply bears out our  suspicions about the inadequacy of the traditional notion of  qualia. Several
varieties of <i>cerebral achromatopsia</i> (brain based  impairment of color vision) have been reported, and
while there  remains much that is unsettled about their analysis, there is  little doubt that the
philosophical thought experiments have  underestimated or overlooked the possibilities for counter- 
intuitive collections of symptoms, as a few very brief excerpts  from case histories will reveal.<p>

<p>

<blockquote>    Objects to the right of the vertical meridian appeared to be of normal hue, while to
the left they were perceived only in shades of gray, though without distortions of form.
.  . He was unable to recognize or name any color in any portion of the left field of
either eye, including bright reds, blues, greens and yellows. As soon as any portion of
the colored object crossed the vertical meridian, he was able to instantly recognize and
accurately name its color. (Damasio et al, 1980)
</blockquote>
 <p>

This patient would seem at first to be unproblematically  describable as suffering a shift or loss of
color qualia in the  left hemifield, but there is a problem of interpretation here,  brought about by
another case:  <p>

<p>

<blockquote>The patient failed in all tasks in which he was required to match the seen color with its
spoken name.  Thus, the patient failed to give the names of colors and failed to choose
a color in response to its name.  By contrast, he succeeded on all tasks where the
matching was either purely verbal or purely nonverbal. Thus, he could give verbally the
names of colors corresponding to named objects and vice versa.  He could match seen
colors to each other and to pictures of objects and could sort colors without error.
(Geschwind and Fusillo (1966)
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>

     This patient  was quite unaware of any deficit. He "never  replied with a simple 'I don't know'" to
the demand for naming a  color." (Geschwind and Fusillo, 1966, p. 140) There is a striking  contrast
between these two patients; both have impaired ability  to name the colors of things in at least part
of their visual  field, but whereas the former is acutely aware of his deficit,  the latter is not. Does this
difference make all the difference  about qualia? If so, what on earth should we say about this third 
patient?<p>

<p>

<blockquote>     His other main complaint was that "everything looked black or grey" and this caused
him some difficulty in everyday life.  . . . He had considerable difficulty recognizing and
naming colours.  He would, for example, usually describe bright red objects as either
red or black, bright green objects as either green, blue or black, and bright blue objects
as black.  The difficulty appeared to be perceptual and he would make remarks
suggesting this; for example when shown a bright red object he said "a dirty smudgy
red, not as red as you would normally see red."  Colours of lesser saturation or
brightness were described in such terms as "grey" "off-white" or "black," but if told to
guess at the colour, he would be correct on about 50 per cent of occasions, being
notably less successful with blues and greens than reds. (Meadows, 1974) 
</blockquote>
<p>

This man's awareness of his deficit is problematic to say the  least. It contrasts rather sharply with yet
another case:<p>

<p>

<blockquote>One morning in November 1977, upon awakening, she noted that although she was
able to see details of objects and people, colors appeared "drained out" and "not true."
She had no other complaint . . . her vision was good, 20/20 in each eye . . . The
difficulty in color perception persisted, and she had to seek the advice of her husband
to choose what to wear.   Eight weeks later she noted that she could no longer
recognize the faces of her husband and daughter . . . [So in] addition to achromatopsia,
the patient had prosopagnosia, but her linguistic and cognitive performances were
otherwise unaffected.  The patient was able to tell her story cogently and to have
remarkable insight about her defects. (Damasio et al, 1980)
</blockquote>
<p>

 As Meadows notes, "Some patients thus complain that their vision  for colours is defective while
others have no spontaneous  complaint but show striking abnormalities on testing." <p>

<p>

     What should one say in these cases? When no complaint is  volunteered but the patient shows an
impairment in color vision,  is this a sign that his qualia are unaffected? ("His capacities  to
discriminate are terribly impaired, but luckily for him, his  inner life is untouched by this merely public
loss!") We could  line up the qualia this way, but equally we could claim that the  patient has simply
not noticed the perhaps gradual draining away  or inversion or merging of his qualia revealed by his
poor  performance. ("So slowly did his inner life lose its complexity  and variety that he never noticed
how impoverished it had  become!")  What if our last patient described her complaint just  as she did
above, but performed normally on testing? One  hypothesis would be that her qualia had indeed, as
she suggested,  become washed out. Another would be that in the light of her  sterling performance
on the color discrimination tests, her  qualia were fine; she was suffering from some hysterical or 
depressive anomaly, a sort of color-vision hypochondria that  makes her complain about a loss of
color perception.  Or perhaps  one could claim that her qualia were untouched; her disorder was 
purely verbal: an anomalous understanding of the words she uses  to describe her experience. (Other
startlingly specific color-  <i>word</i> disorders have been reported in the literature.)<p>

<p>

     The traditional concept leads us to overlook genuine  possibilities.  Once we have learned of the
curious deficit  reported by Geschwind and Fusillo, for instance, we realize that  our first patient was
never tested to see if he could still sort  colors seen on the left or pass other non-naming, non-verbal 
color-blindness tests. Those tests are by no means superfluous.  Perhaps he would have passed them;
perhaps, <i>in spite of what he  says</i> his qualia are as intact for the left field as for the  right!--if we take
the capacity to pass such tests as  "criterial". Perhaps his problem is "purely verbal." If your  reaction
to this hypothesis is that this is impossible, that must  mean you are making his verbal, reporting 
behavior sovereign in  settling the issue--but then you must rule out <i>a priori</i> the  possibility of the
condition I described as color-vision  hypochondria. <p>

<p>

    There is no prospect of <i>finding</i> the answers to these brain teasers in our everyday usage or the
intuitions it arouses, but  it is of course open to the philosopher to <i>create</i> an edifice of  theory
defending a particular set of interlocking proposals. The  problem is that although normally a certain
family of stimulus  and bodily conditions yields a certain family of effects, any  particular effect can
be disconnected, and our intuitions do not  tell us which effects are "essential" to quale identity or
qualia  constancy (Cf. Dennett, 1978a, chapter 11.).  It seems fairly  obvious to me that none of the
real problems of interpretation  that face us in these curious cases are advanced by any analysis  of
how the concept of <i>qualia</i> is to be applied--unless we wish to  propose a novel, technical sense for
which the traditional term  might be appropriated. But that would be at least a tactical  error: the
intuitions that surround and <i>purport</i> to anchor the  current understanding of the term are revealed to
be in utter  disarray when confronted with these cases.<p>

<p>

     My informal sampling shows that some philosophers have  strong opinions about each case and
how it should be described in  terms of qualia, but they find they are in strident (and  ultimately
comic) disagreement with other philosophers about how  these "obvious" descriptions should go.
Other philosophers  discover they really don't know what to say--not because there  aren't enough
facts presented in the descriptions of the cases,  but because it begins to dawn on them that they
haven't really  known what they were talking about over the years. <p>

<p>

<i>6. Filling  the vacuum</i><p>

     If qualia are such a bad idea, why have they seemed to  be such a good idea?  Why does it seem
as if there are these  intrinsic, ineffable, private, "qualitative" properties in our  experience? A review
of the presumptive second-order properties of the properties of our conscious experiences will permit
us to  diagnose their attractiveness and find suitable substitutes. (For  a similar exercise see Kitcher,
1979.)  <p>

<p>

     Consider "intrinsic" first. It is far from clear what an  intrinsic property would be. Although the
term has had a certain  vogue in philosophy, and often seems to secure an important  contrast, there
has never been an accepted definition of the  second-order property of intrinsicality. If even such a
brilliant  theory-monger as David Lewis can try and fail, by his own  admission, to define the
extrinsic/intrinsic distinction  coherently, we can begin to wonder if the concept deserves our  further
attention after all. In fact Lewis (1983) begins his  survey of versions of the distinction by listing as
one option:  "We could Quine the lot, give over the entire family as  unintelligible and dispensable,"
but he dismisses the suggestion  immediately: "That would be absurd." (p.197) In the end, however, 
his effort to salvage the accounts of Chisholm (1976) and Kim  (1982) are stymied, and he
conjectures that "if we still want to  break in we had best try another window." (p.200) <p>

<p>

     Even if we are as loathe as Lewis is to abandon the  distinction, shouldn't we be suspicious of the
following curious  fact?  If challenged to explain the idea of an intrinsic property  to a neophyte, many
people would hit on the following sort of  example: consider Tom's ball; it has many properties, such
as its  being made of rubber from India, its belonging to Tom, its having  spent the last week in the
closet, and its redness.  All but the  last of these are clearly <i>relational</i> or <i>extrinsic</i> properties of  the
ball.  Its redness, however, is an intrinsic property.   Except this isn't so.  Ever since Boyle and Locke
we have known  better.  Redness--public redness--is a quintessentially  relational property, as many
thought experiments about "secondary  qualities" show. (One of the first was Berkeley's (1713) pail
of  lukewarm water, and one of the best is Bennett's (1965) phenol-  thio-urea.) The seductive step,
on learning that public redness  (like public bitterness, etc.) is a relational property after  all, is to cling
to intrinsicality ("<i>something</i> has to be  intrinsic!") and move it into the subject's head. It is often 
thought, in fact, that if we take a Lockean, relational position  on objective bitterness, redness, etc.,
we <i>must</i> complete our  account of the relations in question by appeal to non-relational,  intrinsic
properties. If what it is to be objectively bitter is  to produce a certain effect in the members of the
class of normal  observers, we must be able to specify that effect, and  distinguish it from the effect
produced by objective sourness and  so forth. <p>

<p>

     What else could distinguish this effect but some intrinsic  property? Why not another relational
or extrinsic property? The  relational treatment of monetary value does not require, for its 
completion, the supposition of items of intrinsic value (value  independent of the valuers' dispositions
to react behaviorally).  The claim that certain perceptual properties are different is, in  the absence
of any supporting argument, just question-begging. It  will not do to say that it is just obvious that
they are  intrinsic. It may have seemed obvious to some, but the  considerations raised by Chase's
quandary show that it is far  from obvious that any intrinsic property (whatever that comes to)  could
play the role of anchor for the Lockean relational treat ment of the public perceptual properties.  <p>

<p>

     Why not give up intrinsicality as a second-order property  altogether, at least pending resolution
of the disarray of  philosophical opinion about what intrinsicality might be? Until  such time the
insistence that qualia are the intrinsic properties  of experience is an empty gesture at best; no one
could claim  that it provides a clear, coherent, understood pre-requisite for  theory. <a href="#11.">Endnote 11</a><p>

<p>

     What, then, of ineffability? Why does it seem that our  conscious experiences have ineffable
properties?  Because they do  have <i>practically</i> ineffable properties.  Suppose, in <i>intuition  pump #13:
the osprey cry</i>, that I have never heard the cry of an  osprey, even in a recording, but know roughly,
from reading my  bird books, what to listen for: "a series of short, sharp,  cheeping whistles, <i>cheep,
cheep</i> or <i>chewk chewk</i>, etc; sounds  annoyed." (Peterson, 1947) (or words to that effect or better). 
 The verbal description gives me a partial confinement of the  logical space of possible bird cries.  On
its basis I can rule  out many bird calls I have heard or might hear, but there is  still a broad range of
discriminable-by-me possibilities within  which the actuality lies hidden from me like a needle in a 
haystack. <p>

<p>

     Then one day, armed with both my verbal description and my  binoculars, I identify an osprey
visually, and then hear its cry.   So <i>that's</i> what it sounds like, I say to myself, ostending--it  seems--a
particular mental complex of intrinsic, ineffable  qualia.  I dub the complex "<i>S</i>" (<i>pace</i> Wittgenstein),
rehearse it  in short term memory, check it against the bird book  descriptions, and see that while the
verbal descriptions are  true, accuurate and even poetically evocative--I decide I could  not do better
with a thousand words--they still fall short of  <i>capturing</i> the qualia-complex I have called <i>S</i>.  In fact,
that is  why I need the neologisim, "S", to refer directly to the  ineffable property I cannot pick out
by description.  My  perceptual experience has pinpointed for me the location of the  osprey cry in
the logical space of possibilities in a way verbal  description could not. <p>

<p>

     But tempting as this view of matters is, it is overstated.   First of all, it is obvious that from a single
experience of this  sort I don't--can't--know how to generalize to other osprey  calls.  Would a cry
that differed only in being half an octave  higher also be an osprey call?  That is an empirical, 
ornithological question for which my experience provides scant  evidence.  But moreover--and this
is a psychological, not  ornithological matter--I don't and can't know, from a single such  experience,
which physical variations and constancies in stimuli  would produce an indistinguishable experience
in me.  Nor can I  know whether I would react the same (have the same experience) if  I were
presented with what was, by all physical measures, a re-  stimulation identical to the first. I cannot
know the modulating  effect, if any, of variations in my body (or psyche). <p>

<p>

     This inscrutability of projection is surely one of the  sources of plausibility for Wittgenstein's
skepticism regarding  the possibility of a private language. <p>

<p>

<blockquote>     Wittgenstein emphasizes that ostensive definitions are always in principle capable
of being misunderstood, even the ostensive definition of a color word such as "sepia".
How someone understands the word is exhibited in the way someone goes on, "the use
that he makes of the word defined". One may go on in the right way given a purely
minimal explanation, while on the other hand one may go on in another way no matter
how many clarifications are added, since these too can be misunderstood  . . . (Kripke,
1982, p.83. See also pp. 40-46.) 
</blockquote>
<p>

But what is inscrutable in a single glance, and somewhat  ambiguous after limited testing, can come
to be justifiably seen  as the deliverance of a highly specific, reliable, and  projectible
property-detector, once it has been field-tested  under a suitably wide variety of circumstances. <p>

<p>

     In other words, when first I hear the osprey cry, I may have  identified a property-detector in
myself, but I have no idea  (yet) what property my newfound property-detector detects. It  might
seem then that I know nothing new at all--that my novel  experience has not improved my epistemic
predicament in the  slightest.  But of course this is not so.  I may not be able to  describe the property
or identify it relative to any readily  usable public landmarks (yet), but I am acquainted with it in a 
modest way: I can refer to the property I detected: it is the  property I detected in <i>that</i> event.  My
experience of the osprey  cry has given me a new way of thinking about osprey cries (an  unavoidably
inflated way of saying something very simple) which  is practically ineffable both because it has (as
yet for me) an  untested profile in response to perceptual circumstances, and  because it is--as the
poverty of the bird-book description  attests--such a highly informative way of thinking: a deliverance 
of an informationally very sensitive portion of my nervous  system. <p>

<p>

     In this instance I mean information in the formal  information theory sense of the term. Consider
(<i>intuition pump  #14: the Jello box</i>) the old spy trick, most famously encountered  in the case of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, of improving on a  password system by tearing something in two (a Jello
box, in the  Rosenberg's case), and giving half to each of the two parties who  must be careful about
identifying each other.  Why does it work?   Because tearing the paper in two produces an edge of
such  informational complexity that it would be virtually impossible to  reproduce by deliberate
construction.  (Cutting the Jello box  with straight edge and razor would entirely defeat the purpose.) 
 The particular jagged edge of one piece becomes a <i>practically</i>  unique pattern-recognition device
for its mate; it is an  apparatus for detecting the shape propert <i>M</i>, where <i>M</i> is uniquely  instantiated
by its mate.  It is of the essence of the trick that  we cannot replace our dummy predicate "M" with
a longer, more  complex, but accurate and exhaustive description of the property,  for if we could,
we could use the description as a recipe or  feasible algorithm for producing another instance of <i>M</i>
or another  <i>M</i>-detector. The only <i>readily available</i> way of saying what  property <i>M</i> is is just to point
to our <i>M</i>-detector and say that <i>M</i>  is the shape property detected by this thing here.<p>

<p>

     And that is just what we do when we seem to ostend, with the  mental finger of inner intention,
a quale or qualia-complex in  our experience.  We refer to a property--a public property of  uncharted
boundaries--via reference to our personal and  idiosyncratic capacity to respond to it.  That
idiosyncracy is  the extent of our privacy. If I wonder whether your blue is my  blue, your middle-C
is my middle-C, I can coherently be wondering  whether our discrimination profiles over a wide
variation in  conditions will be approximately the same.  And they may not be;  people experience the
world quite differently.  But that is  empiricially discoverable by all the usual objective testing 
procedures. <a href="#12.">Endnote 12</a> <p>

<p>

     Peter Bieri has pointed out to me that there is a natural  way of exploiting Dretske's (1981) sense
of information in a reformula tion of my first three second-order properties of qualia: intrin sicality,
ineffability, and privacy. (There are problems with  Dretske's attempt to harness information theory
in this way--see  my discussion in "Evolution, Error and Intentionality" (Dennett,  1987)--but they
are not relevant to this point.)  We could speak  of what Bieri would call "phenomenal information
properties" of  psychological events. Consider the information--what Dretske  would call the <i>natural
meaning</i>--that a type of internal  perceptual event might carry. That it carries that information is  an
objective (and hence, in a loose sense, intrinsic) matter  since it is independent of what information
(if any) the subject  <i>takes</i> the event type to carry.  Exactly what information is  carried is (practically)
ineffable, for the reasons just given.  And it is private in the sense just given: proprietary and 
potentially idiosyncratic. <p>

<p>

     Consider how Bieri's proposed "phenomenal information  properties" (let's call them <i>pips</i>) would
apply in the case of  Chase and Sanborn.  Both Chase and Sanborn ought to wonder  whether their
pips have changed. Chase's speech shows that he is  under the impression that his pips are unchanged
(under normal  circumstances--all bets are off if he has just eaten  horseradish). He believes that the
same objective things in the  world--in particular, chemically identical caffeine-rich fluids--  give rise
to his particular types of taste-experiences now as six  years ago. <p>

<p>

     Sanborn is under the impression that his pips are different.  He thinks his objective
property-detectors are deranged. He no  longer has confidence that their deliverances today inform
him of  what they did six years ago. And what, exactly, did they inform  him of then?  If Sanborn were
an ordinary person, we would not  expect him to have an explicit answer, since most of us treat our 
taste-detectors as mere <i>M</i>-detectors, detecting whatever-it-is  that they detect. (There are good
reasons for this, analyzed by  Akins 1987). But professional coffee-tasters are probably  different.
They probably have some pretty good idea of what kind  of chemical-analysis transduction machinery
they have in their  mouths and nervous systems.<p>

<p>

     So far, so good. We could reinterpret Chase and Sanborn's  speeches as hypotheses about the
constancies or changes in the  outputs of their perceptual information-processing apparatus, and  just
the sort of empirical testing we imagined before would tend  to confirm or disconfirm their opinions
thus interpreted.  But  what would justify calling such an information-bearing  property 
"phenomenal"?  <p>

<p>

      Such a pip has, as the testimony of Chase and Sanborn  reveals, the power to provoke in Chase
and Sanborn  acts of  (apparent) re-identification or recognition. This power is of  course a Lockean,
dispositional property on a par with the power  of bitter things to provoke a certain reaction in
people. It is  this power alone, however it might be realized in the brain, that  gives Chase and
Sanborn "access" to the deliverances of their  individual property-detectors. <p>

<p>

     We may "point inwardly" to one of the deliverances of our  idiosyncratic, proprietary
property-detectors, but when we do,  what are we pointing <i>at</i>? What does that deliverance itself 
<i>consist of</i>?  Or what are its consciously apprehensible proper ties, if not just our banished friends the
qualia? We must be  careful here, for if we invoke an inner perceptual process in  which we observe
the deliverance with some inner eye and thereby  discern its properties, we will be stepping back into
the frying  pan of the view according to which qualia are just ordinary  properties of our inner states. <p>

<p>

     But nothing requires us to make such an invocation. We don't  have to know how we identify or
re-identify or gain access to  such internal response types in order to be able so to identify  them. 
This is a point that was forcefully made by the pioneer  functionalists and materialists, and has never
been rebutted  (Farrell, 1950, Smart, 1959). The properties of the "thing  experienced" are not to be
confused with the properties of the  event that realizes the experiencing. To put the matter vividly, 
the physical difference between someone's imagining a purple cow  and imagining a green cow <i>might</i>
be nothing more than the presence  or absence of a particular zero or one in one of the brain's 
"registers".  Such a brute physical presence is all that it would  take to anchor the sorts of
dispositional differences between  imagining a purple cow and imagining a green cow  that could then 
flow, causally, from that "intrinsic" fact. (I doubt that this is  what the friends of qualia have had in
mind when they have  insisted that qualia are intrinsic properties.)    <p>

<p>

     Moreover, it is our very inability to expand on, or modify,  these brute dispositions so to identify
or recognize such states  that creates the doctrinal illusion of "homogeneity" or  "atomicity to
analysis" or "grainlessness" that characterizes the  qualia of philosophical tradition. <p>

<p>

     This putative grainlessness, I hypothesize, is nothing but a  sort of functional invariability: it is
close kin to what  Pylyshyn (1980, 1984) calls <i>cognitive impenetrability</i>.  Moreover,  this functional
invariability or impenetrability is not absolute  but itself plastic over time.  Just as on the efferent side
of  the nervous system, <i>basic actions</i>--in the sense of Danto (1963,  1965) and others (see Goldman,
1970)--have been discovered to be  variable, and subject under training to decomposition (one can 
learn with the help of "biofeedback" to will the firing of a  particular motor neuron "directly"), so
what counts for an  individual as the simple or atomic properties of experienced  items is subject to
variation with training. <a href="#13.">Endnote 13</a><p>

<p>

     Consider the results of "educating" the palate of a wine  taster, or "ear training" for musicians. 
What had been "atomic"  or "unanalyzable" becomes noticeably compound and describable;  pairs that
had been indistinguishable become distinguishable, and  when this happens we say <i>the experience
chances</i>. A swift and  striking example of this is illustrated in <i>intuition pump #15:  the guitar string</i>. 
Pluck the bass or low E string open, and  listen carefully to the sound. Does it have describable parts
or  is it one and whole and ineffably guitarish?  Many will opt for  the latter way of talking. Now
pluck the open string again and  carefully bring a finger down lightly over the octave fret to  create
a high "harmonic".  Suddenly a <i>new</i> sound is heard: "purer"  somehow and of course an octave
higher.  Some people insist that  this is an entirely novel sound, while others will describe the 
experience by saying "the bottom fell out of the note"--leaving  just the top.  But then on a third open
plucking one can hear,  with surprising distinctness, the harmonic overtone that was  isolated in the
second plucking.  The homogeneity and  ineffability of the first experience is gone, replaced by a 
duality as "directly apprehensible" and clearly describable as  that of any chord.  <p>

<p>

     The difference in experience is striking, but the complexity  apprehended on the third plucking was
<i>there</i> all along (being  responded to or discriminated). After all, it was by the complex  pattern of
overtones that you were able to recognize the sound as  that of a guitar rather than a lute or
harpsichord. In other  words, although the subjective experience has changed  dramatically, the <i>pip</i>
hasn't changed; you are still responding,  as before, to a complex property so highly informative that
it  practically defies verbal description. <p>

<p>

     There is nothing to stop further refinement of one's cap acity to describe this heretofore ineffable
complexity. At any  time, of course, there is one's current horizon of distinguisha bility--and that
horizon is what sets, if anything does, what we  should call the primary or atomic properties of what 
one con sciously experiences (Farrell, 1950).  But it would be a mistake  to transform the fact that
inevitably there is a limit to our  capacity to describe things we experience into the supposition  that
there are absolutely indescribable properties in our  experience. <p>

<p>

     So when we look one last time at our original  characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic,
private,  directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that  there is nothing to fill the bill. 
In their place are relatively  or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to  indirectly via
reference to our private property-detectors--  private only in the sense of idiosyncratic.  And insofar
as we  wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence  within us of states of certain
types or with certain properties,  we can have some authority--not infallibility or incorrigibility,  but
something better than sheer guessing--but only if we restrict  ourselves to relational, extrinsic
properties like the power of  certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re- 
identification.  So contrary to what seems obvious at first  blush, there simply are no qualia at all.

<a name="1.">1.</a> A representative sample of the most recent literature on  qualia would include Block 1980;
Shoemaker, 1981, 1982; Davis,  1982; White, 1984; Armstrong and Malcom, 1984; Churchland,
1985,  and Conee, 1985.<p>

<a name="2.">2.</a> The difference between "eliminative materialism"--of which my  position on qualia is an
instance--and a "reductive" materialism  that takes on the burden of identifying the problematic item
in  terms of the foundational materialistic theory is thus often best  seen not so much as a doctrinal
issue as a tactical issue: how  might we most gracefully or effectively enlighten the confused in  this
instance?  See my discussion of "fatigues" in the  Introduction to <i>Brainstorms</i> (Dennett, 1978a), and
earlier, my  discussion of what the enlightened ought to say about the  metaphysical status of <i>sakes</i>
and <i>voices</i> in <i>Content and  Consciousness</i> (Dennett, 1969), ch. 1.<p>

<a name="3.">3.</a> The plausibility of this concession depends less on a high  regard for the technology than on a
proper skepticism about human  powers, now documented in a fascinating study by Lehrer (1983)<p>

<a name="4.">4.</a> Shoemaker (1984) seems to be moving reluctantly towards  agreement with this conclusion: "So
unless we can find some  grounds on which we can deny the possibility of the sort of  situation
envisaged . . . we must apparently choose between  rejecting the functionalist account of qualitative
similarity and  rejecting the standard conception of qualia.<p>

<blockquote>     I would prefer not to have to make this choice; but if I am  forced to make it, I
reject the standard conception of qualia."  (p. 356).
</blockquote>
<a name="5.">5.</a> Shoemaker (1982) attributes a view to Wittgenstein  (acknowledging that "it is none too clear" that
this is actually  what Wittgenstein held) which is very close to the view I defend  here.  But to
Shoemaker, "it would seem offhand that Wittgenstein  was mistaken" (p.360), a claim Shoemaker
supports with a far from  offhand thought experiment--which Shoemaker misanalyzes if the  present
paper is correct. (There is no good reason, contrary to  Shoemaker's declaration, to believe that his
subject's <i>experience</i>  is systematically different from what it was before the  inversion.) Smart (1959)
expresses guarded and partial approval  of Wittgenstein's hard line, but cannot see his way clear to
as  uncompromising an eliminativism as I maintain here.<p>

<a name="6.">6.</a> In 1979, I read an earlier version of this paper in Oxford,  with a commentary by John Foster, who
defended qualia to the last  breath, which was: "qualia should not be quined but fostered!"  Symmetry
demands, of course, the following definition for the 8th  edition of <i>The Philosophical Lexicon</i>:
"foster, v.  To acclaim  resolutely the existence or importance of something chimerical  or
insignificant."<p>

<a name="7.">7.</a> This example first appeared in print in my Reflections on  Smullyan in <i>The Mind's I</i>, Hofstadter and
Dennett, 1981, pp.427-8. <p>

<a name="8.">8.</a>  Kripke (1982) comes close, when he asks rhetorically "Do I  not know, directly, and <i>with a fair
degree of certainty</i> [emphasis  added], that I mean plus [by the function I call "plus"]?"(p.40)  Kripke
does not tell us what is implied by "a fair degree of  certainty", but presumably he means by this
remark to declare his  allegiance to what Millikan (1984) attacks under the name of  "meaning
rationalism."<p>

<a name="9.">9.</a> We can save the traditional claim by ignoring presumably  private or subjective qualia and talking
always of public  tastes--such as the public taste of Maxwell House coffee that  both Chase and
Sanborn agree has remained constant.  Individuals  can be said to acquire a taste for such a public
taste.<p>

<a name="10.">10.</a> "I am not so wild as to deny that my sensation of red today  is like my sensation of red yesterday. 
I only say that the  similarity can <i>consist</i> only in the physiological force behind  consciousness--which
leads me to say, I recognize this feeling  the same as the former one, and so does not consist in a 
community of sensation."--C. S. Peirce, <i>Collected Works</i>, Vol V,  p. 172, fn.2.<p>

<a name="11.">11.</a> A heroic (and, to me, baffling) refusal to abandon  intrinsicality is Wilfrid Sellars' contemplation
over the years  of his famous pink ice cube, which leads him to postulate a  revolution in
microphysics, restoring objective "absolute sensory  processes" in the face of Boyle and Locke and
almost everybody  since them. See Sellars (1981) and my commentary (Dennett, 1981). <p>

<a name="12.">12.</a> Stich (1983) discusses the implications for psychological  theory of incommensurability problems
that can arise from such  differences in discrimination profiles.  See esp. chs. 4 and 5.<p>

<a name="13.">13.</a>  See Churchland (1979) esp. ch 2, for supporting observations  on the variability of perceptual
properties, and for novel argu ments against the use of "intrinsic properties" as determiners of  the
meaning of perceptual predicates.  See also Churchland (1985)  for further arguments and
observations in support of the position  sketched here.<p>

<a name="14.">14.</a> The first version of this paper was presented at University  College, London, in November 1978,
and in various revisions at a  dozen other universities in 1979 and 1980. It was never  published, but
was circulated widely as Tufts University  Cognitive Science Working Paper #7, December 1979. A
second  version was presented at the Universities of Adelaide and Sydney  in 1984, and in 1985 to
psychology department colloquia at  Harvard and Brown under the title "Properties of Conscious 
Experience." The second version was the basis for my presentation  at the workshop on
consciousness in modern science, Villa Olmo,  Como, Italy, April 1985, and circulated in preprint in
1985,  again under the title "Quining Qualia." The present version, the  fourth, is a substantial
revision, thanks to the helpful comments  of many people, including Kathleen Akins, Ned Block, Alan
Cowey,  Sydney Shoemaker, Peter Bieri, William Lycan, Paul Churchland,  Gilbert Harman and the
participants at Villa Olmo.   <p>
