<h2><a name="_Toc7457520">Assumptions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>consciousness is not (methodologically) important to AI &#8211; we
can pretend it doesn't exist, and at a certain point will probably just say
that it suddenly does, and we can't predict how/what we&#8217;ll conclude exactly
about it till then</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there is little information/computation contributed below a
certain level of physiological coarseness (i.e. if we don't model that
fine-grained computation, it will be incorporated somehow at a higher level)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>much of what we seek to model about the brain can be
produced within today-like/near-future technology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spiking is important(???) &#8211; everywhere??? synchronicity???
something else about the APs themselves??? (see Berger Liaw speech recognition???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>language is not just another generic cognitive process, but
requires an (evolved) specialisation (to some degree)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>language reflects the syntax/structure of the environment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>the subject-object conceptual
scheme arises inevitably for agents out of their very environment-syntax</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the purposes of language are two-fold: communication; and
shaping the form and power of one's own thoughts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>what&#8217;s the adaptive value of
communication???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>why do they gabble???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>perhaps sign language/semaphore
(= less complicated motor output)??? perhaps it started as shouting with
different levels of urgency</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>embodiment, to some degree is important - senses and motor
are bound up together, and interacting and being affected by the environment is
vital to learning - feedback</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in'>language is the tip of the cognitive iceberg;
human-like language is impossible without human-like experience and limitations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sense of self is an emergent phenomenon</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>self-organisation is the key, and highly commercialisable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>free will = multiple drafts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we should take our lead from nature, but not her details -
in marr's words, the computational theory and probably most of the algorithms
should have biological parallels, but not the implementation (hardware or
software) at all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wherever possible, we should aim to replicate experimental
data</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>most of nature's solutions are parallel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>robustness is vital &#8211; vitality is robust</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>low-level neural structures are not evolutionarily
specified, but arise out of a combination of developmental (spatial and timing)
constraints, structure in the environment and learning &#8211; interactionism &#8211; but
interactionism can produce surprisingly specific and stereotyped results</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>defined functional or spatial areas (modules) are the
exception</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life isn't discrete, it doesn't have discrete processes,
partly because they&#8217;re fault-intolerant, and partly because it makes the parts
of the system less informationally open to each other (and you never know which
stage of computation will be useful to another process)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one of the special things about connectionism is that the
processing and the representation are contained within the same mechanism/structure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the fundamental life-processes and much of nature utilises
similar basic features</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there is something special about the brain&#8217;s physical
implementation that gives rise to consciousness???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>consciousness = computation???_ = epiphenomenal???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>consciousness definitely does not play a significant role in
low-level processes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have no way of knowing whether consciousness is an
epiphenomenon, i.e. whether it has a causal role, even for the highest-level
processes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>empathy/sympathy derives from a theory of mind (and a rich
internal model of the world and agents), an aversion to pain and living in a
dangerous environment (i.e. being limited and mortal)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassion??? = sympathy + intelligence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have nothing (little???) to fear from highly-embodied
robots of superior intelligence??? as long as they have similar emotions??? &#8211;
even if we do have something to fear, it&#8217;s for the (utilitarian) best???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:blue'>in most cases, the best and
lowest-level explanation of certain complex brain states and neuronal ensembles
will be in high-level, non-neural, i.e. psychological terms, just as we have
been doing</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>agree with Pinker + Jackendorff that to at least some
extent, our grammar + modes of expression follow more basic themes related to
the way in which we function in the world (see thesis notes)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>major problems in connectionism at the moment:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>need to figure out more when we
need to be biologically plausible and when just inspired &#8211; what the lowest
important level of computation is, and for what type of problem, what
information is lost when you just look at APs, and what further information is
lost if you just look at mean rates etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>consider different types of
neurotransmitters (including fixed-weight inhibition), neuromodulators,
hormones etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>reward systems as part of
unsupervised learning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>architectural, timing, spatial,
neuron-type constraints as interactionist epigenetic variables</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>incorporating multi-input,
-type, -purpose, -function, -coarseness of representations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>sequential, variable-input-size,
continuous, contextualised input with similar type of output</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>learning rules that don't
require specific, layered homogenous architectures</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presumably, the faculty by which language communities
emerge/arise (e.g. children forming full-fledged creoles) utilises more or less
the same processes by which we learn a given language</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for the most part our brains operate in sequential, real
time, clamped conditions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life (and maybe the universe) likes to segregate levels</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>e.g. quantum and classical,
physical/chemical/biological</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>witness how the way our brains
work on a high level is unrecognisably different the way they work on a low
level (e.g. the fact that our auditory system does fourier transforms standing
on its head, but we find it hard &#8211; wouldn't it be fun to momentarily disconnect
our ears, and then feed ourselves calculations through a mini-electrode?!?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.7pt'>we are singularly ill-equipped
for understanding ourselves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>you know how greenbeard genes are brigands (???), because
they highjack the evolutionary process for themselves at the expense of the
rest of the genome??? might it be the same if one part of our brain was able to
control (through man-made electrical stimulation) other parts???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is increased understanding and manipulation of our brain
processes going to alleviate or worsen our worries about free will???</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457521">Highly alternative forms of language</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>how about 2 words, each highly inflected</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the verb is the centre of transformational grammar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lying (or the ability to form counterfactuals) is the sign
of meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how about music (chords, pitch/volume) as an analogy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our language is discrete, formed of sentence units &#8211; how
about a continuous language, like an always-on verbal report?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>subject-objects vs participants</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457522">What must we share with an intelligent alien?</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>evolution (of some description) &#8211; search through space</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will life on another planet be distinguishable??? isn't this
the ultimate conclusion of Gaia, that life as a process can't be singled out,
that life exists on exactly the same level as (e.g.) the weather???</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc7457530">Cognitive science</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>let&#8217;s say I agree with everything in Brooks (&#8216;AI through
building robots&#8217;) about the need for a complex, real environment that the AI
has to perceive and do the abstracting from itself without a human interpreter,
and that there is a need for a certain degree of modularity but we don&#8217;t yet
know at all how to structure that modularity &#8211; he argues that we need to start
from simpler systems and work our way up to more complex systems &#8211; might there
be an environment in which we could build a <i>simple, language-using</i>
creature, just as he&#8217;s building insects with simple real-world-suited
perceptual capacities&#8230;???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what&#8217;s Steve Grand&#8217;s point that Stringer was talking about
related to the coarseness of the model of the VR world model you use???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>what will the goal/label of AI
be over the next century - what can i realistically hope to achieve???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-autospace:none'>consciousness,
probably not, esp not an understanding of it - that's a problem outside science
and the methodologies of NNs and programming etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-autospace:none'>understanding
- hmmm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-autospace:none'>intelligence -

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-autospace:none'>autonomy, in
real-life situations =&gt; 2 domains of AI - robots/objects +
words/speech/communication/info-processing - will robots + readers be difficult
to unify???</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457531">Connectionism</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>might there be some sort of interaction effect that makes
the combination of evolution and connectionism particularly powerful??? hence
metanet being a new level above what we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it seems like there&#8217;s a trade-off between accuracy of
neuronal model and number of neurons, so I should figure out which one matters
most</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about having hemispherical or only sparsely distributed
systems, which is more biologically plausible anyway, the functional
segregation might even be an advantage in some way, and would make it easier
for distributed processing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about if I set up a bunch of little nets, and overlap
them, in different planes, so that they randomly share different neurons &#8211; the
input neuron from one could be the output neuron from another, some of whose
middle-layer neurons are the middle-layer of another net&#8230;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>given the robustness of neural nets,
coping with lesions, degradations, different activation functions and firing
rates, diluted connectivity etc., and the fact that a single weight can be
considered to be playing a different role in the net depending on which pattern
is active and how much input it is getting, even without the weight itself
actually changing, why can&#8217;t a neuron play different roles at different layers
simultaneously in many neural nets??? I could train all these nets at once,
perhaps cycling through them all one by one or randomly (just like training
patterns offline).</p>

margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>what would be the advantage of
this??? well, it&#8217;s one way to add greater complexity and interactivity in our
nets. it might also allow them to self-organise in cool, unexpected ways. and
after all, the brain looks a mess, and this would create a mess, perhaps
they&#8217;ll be similar messes&#8230; plus, it would be economical with neurons.</p>

nets together??? well, I'd use a genetic algorithm to structure it somehow.
perhaps using tracer lines to map out vague directions and structures, with
parameters like connectivity and distance of connections which would vary in
different places. back to the idea of local parameters, and different
localised-effect neurotransmitters/modulators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>somehow though, the system has to be able to see things on

<p class=MsoNormal>henry segerman - consciousness *is* complexity of processing
- a brain is conscious in an emergent way by dint of its numerous neurons and
their multiplexity of connections to each other. but wouldn't a river or a rock
then be conscious, since the level of activity on an atomic level is no
different between brains and beans. in fact, we can only speak of the brain as
complex on a cellular level. on an atomic level, it may be no denser or more
energetic or more diverse chemically than a bowl of soup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>yes, it may be that consciousness arises panpsychically out
of everything, but we can only interpret something to be (humanly) conscious if
we can make sense of its behaviour. indeed, we will never even be sure that
humanly-behaving zombies are conscious, though to henry, the question wouldn't
have any meaning - since consciousness *is* the process. there is no way to
exhibit human-level complexity of behaviour without being conscious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he needs to address the hard problem of why we have qualia,
where they come from, why they appear to have a contingent relationship to
whatever explanation we come up with, and why physicalist objective
perspectives are unable to account for them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what is memory? memory consists of two things - the data
itself, that becomes information when interpreted by a memory reader - thus,
dna is nothing but strings of molecules until the cell performs operations on
them (chemical reactions) which instantiate their content. without a process
which acts on the contents of memory, the reader, the memory data are just the
result of all the atomic physical processes that have led up to the current
state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>binary digits are not information until the assembler works
on them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the synaptic connections in our brains are complicated,
because a neural network does not have a separate memory in the way that the
traditional von Neumann machine does (as separate from the processing
component, e.g. the CPU/RAM distinction in a modern PC)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the answer to Henry's incidental question is: depends
whether you can adequately simulate whatever that new physics is in your
computer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how does telepathy affect the subjective/objective
distinction?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if we focus our efforts on finding a testable
criterion/measure of consciousness, even if it's a little inadequate around the
edges, then we could start up a discipline of mental systems, which works on
quantifying the consciousness of a system and figuring out what goes into
making that consciousness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what was susan greenfield's quantification of consciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry is proposing consciousness is a gestalt process</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gestalt - grasp problem all together, work out solution
mentally before breaking into bits </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i'm anti-reductionist by tom nagel's description, cos i
believe that a radical new understanding of physical laws is necessary to
bridge the explanatory gap - that is not to say that i don't think that
physical science of an expanded and probably paradigmatically different kind
cannot one day come very much closer. but i don't understand how you could call
any variant of functionalism or especially anomalous monism *scientific*. i
still don't even understand how they could work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there a name for henry's 'consciousness emerges from the
process, *is* the process, is just stuff happening'? functionalism, sort of -
yes, it's looking at the functional organisation in action. surely at the very
least these theories would need to talk more about what it is about the
functional organisation/process that gives rise to consciousness, or at least
address the question of whether all processes, i.e. everything, is conscious,
and if not, then what is?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>indeed it is this predictive power that identifies a
scientific theory, its objective, verifiable/testable hypotheses, quantifiable,
reproducible measurements are necessary for that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>without this sort of dividing line separating functional
processes that give rise to consciousness and those that don't, you actually do
end up a panpsychist, don't you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the functional reorganisation model in speech perception,

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry S - amnesia would be something to fear. Yes, but not
because youd feel pain. Amnesia to the extent of being able to swap minds is neural

<p class=MsoNormal>HenryS: no fears of pain are going to reach through that

<p class=MsoNormal>what about if you could implant neuron-transistors in your

this, but starts to experience strange effects, a la travolta in phenomenon.
eventually, he is forced to reload his backup at time of mind-expansion, but
this means losing everything he has become in the intervening months. the short

<p class=MsoNormal>is the brain a formal system?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it would make sense to say that processing -&gt; conscious
experience, since higher levels of the brain are most conscious, and the brain
is the most conscious of all known processing mechanisms. but what is it about
processing, and how can we define processing in this way, so that we can even
imagine how it might lead to conscious experience</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what if it turned out that we couldn&#8217;t get rid of pain just

our physical presence giving rise to pain when intruded&#8230; - like the MHC???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or if we've used futuristic evolutionary techniques to
physically build our computer-personality, we might not even know exactly what
it is about the robot brain that is important that we need to save... I'm not

the act of the perceiver, the qualia-mentality that we impose as truly

is a (systematic???) relationship (and I am here avoiding calling this an
identity) between &#8216;lightning&#8217; as we see it and electrical discharge (for

<h5>Topographising</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every neuron is its own object, with properties like
activation function, threshold, resistance to lesioning??? etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A group is also an object. It consists of a list of neurons
which belong to it (a neuron can belong to more than one group). Belonging to a
group doesn't necessarily mean that you're connected to any of the other
neurons in that group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can define a group. There's no distinction made between
input neurons and hidden neurons and output neurons at this stage. However, the
input neurons are considered to be simply any neurons that have inputs from
outside the group (so an input neuron in one group may be a hidden/output neuron
in another, and vice versa), and hidden and output neurons are similarly
defined relative to that group. (arguably of course, one can talk in terms of
network-wide input, hidden and output neurons too - remember in fact that the
network is itself also a (super-)group). In this way, one neuron could be both
an input and an output neuron (though not, of course, also a hidden neuron). I
might recruit a bunch of neurons into a group, some of which have inputs from
outside the group and some have outputs to outside the group. But these input
and output neurons within the group might not actually be connected to each
other at all - in this way, group boundaries need not necessarily follow
functional boundaries, though they probably will in most cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>I need to be able to define the
inter-group connections in terms of the inputs to a group or in terms of the
outputs from another group - this requires a non-group-centred (i.e.
Network/neuron-centred) representation of the total synaptic organisation. I
imagine this means that if i'm looking at a given group as a programmer/user,
it has to continually refresh by checking through all the neurons in the
network to see which neurons are connected in - this means that it will always
be up to date, though it will be slow - however, when the network is actually
running, this won't be relevant, because the network runs by cycling through
the neurons and completely ignores group boundaries</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of all this, it has to check to see whether
neurons which are members of more than group have been given competing
instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>What sort of default instructions
might there be???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>e.g. It might broadly specify a
connectivity pattern tween neurons - but then some neurons will be connected to
those and more. If so, could some pairs of neurons be connected together more
than once??? Does this happen in the brain???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other reason for doing this is so that I can integrate
symbolic modules. Every group object can have one or more symbolic modules
attached. You specify which neurons these link into/out of, and how they affect
or are affected by these neurons&#8217; activities. For instance, in the case of the
group which consists of input neurons and output neurons that are not actually
connected to each other at all (it&#8217;s not necessary that they remain
unconnected, but it&#8217;s simpler to assume they are for the sake of the example),
I might have a symbolic module that does a parity check on the input neurons,
and alters the output neurons correspondingly. In this way, the symbolic module
can act as a bridge between neurons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Ideally, one day we&#8217;ll know how
this might be implemented through a combination of genetic, developmental and
learning processes, but in the meantime, we&#8217;re most interested in is the
functional goings on. Of course, those striving for biological plausibility
needn&#8217;t implement symbolic modules (except maybe just for convenience/speed, if
they&#8217;re absolutely certain that they could employ a functionally-identical set
of neurons in its place).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, the symbolic module could link in and back out to
the same neurons, e.g. For scaling a vector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Incidentally, this will be how
sensory inputs and motor outputs will be represented &#8211; the network input
neurons will have a symbolic module which could be a quakec interface, a number
generator, a database of images, text, a video camera or whatever. Likewise,
the symbolic module linked to the network output neurons could translate into
keystrokes for quake, motor commands to muscles, irc-style text or whatever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You could also use this symbolic module system for compiling
reports. You create a special group containing all the neurons you&#8217;re
interested in. You write a special symbolic module that outputs the information
about those neurons to a file in a prespecified format, and then at the end of
the day, it&#8217;ll automatically create a log of all and only the information you
need, without affecting those neurons&#8217; activity</p>

<h5>Misc</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>how important is the whole fast/slow-adapting thing???
eliminates redundancy &#8211; could be done second-order like in visual system rather
than first-order like rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors??? kind of like a
differentiating function???</p>

functionality???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>express the stereotyped connections in terms of formulae
(parse in Polish notation???)</p>

<h5>Questions</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is there any way to make the formal description of the whole
system abstract enough to be explored/monitored by either a meta-GA or a
meta-NN???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is there a problem with having each synapse having its own
distance, because it&#8217;ll mean that a really long axon which branches at the very
end to reach loads of nearby neurons will have a very high total synapse
connection distance???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The solution might be to have one
strong connection to a neuron at that end, and for it to be connected to all
the nearby neurons &#8211; but will this be difficult to express in my neuron topography
formulae/formulisms??? And how do I ensure that the connection stays strong???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can I specify that a connection should stay strong??? Well,
I can just make sure that the only input that neuron has is that connection,
and then it&#8217;ll be bound to stay practically 100%, won&#8217;t it???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Find out how Cog mixes all the systems up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To what extent should I build in the GA and spatial
organisation stuff into the network from the beginning???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>I think that neurons should have
the spatial properties built in from the start, and everything should be
defined in terms of being just one agent object within a population, but
there&#8217;s no need to fully flesh it out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The big problem is the GA, and the
extent to which the user can hand-code things, and the extent to which it can
all be specified in the GA &#8211; the GA data structure is going to be crucial</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457542">Quake bot</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quake bots &#8211; hope will lead to forward planning, hiding and
interception, different techniques for different predators and weapons,
prioritisation (study behaviour by experimenting with counterfactuals),
different cognitive sub-modules, introduce very simple inter-bot communication
and hope to see arbitrary code (cf vervet grunts) evolve, cultural and social
learning, selfish genes (kin recognition???), deception</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457543">Go</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>the thing about go is that it's always wheels within wheels.
on one level of play in a game, it's about 3 or 4 pieces fighting not to be
captured, because they're part of a large structure which is going to fall one
way or the other and these snake across the board writhing in between each
other, until you see battlegrounds emerging within the landscape of the whole
board. a markov chain in language is like this - in a way, we're choosing our
next word on the basis of the preceding word, or to fit in to a phrase (but
that phrase is NOT just constructed left-to-right - that's the problem with
markov chains ... ???), or to fit in with what has come before in the whole
sentence. that's why they are always more than one states, and the higher the
more powerful. do they have a 2- within a 3- within a 4-, or just a 4-??? could
we not try a similar strategy in go???</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457554">Language</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>the fact that there are so many natural languages seems to
indicate that we form languages easily as a community, and (perhaps???) that we
form them *most* easily with a small, local community - perhaps we can learn
something from empirical evidence about the number of interactions/geography
etc. and how that relates to dialects and the ease with which languages merge,
grow</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>language as a species, dialects as sub-species???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the process by which infants form syntactic categories
while placing words in those syntactic categories similar to the one by which
we mutually/communally create languages??? read up on pidgin stuff</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forming syntactic categories as infants at the same time as
placing words in them is a typical unsupervised learning task</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about if you restrict yourself to a vocabulary of

<p class=MsoNormal>find out about the Chomskyan school that considers
deep/D-structure to *be* meaning - is that the same as saying that it is the LOT???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>language is too fine-grained: a dog might 'expect his master
home soon' but we cannot say that the dog 'expects a painter called Tom [i.e.
his master] home soon' - this feels important - how can i try and develop a
limited-language in a limited domain along these lines???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ it effectively amounts to compressing the information

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ unfortunately, this method won't necessarily yield
nouns/verbs etc. but probably hybrids - and this is where nozak et al.'s paper
comes in - unless you increase the number of interacting objects and the number
of possible interactions exponentially, while keeping the number of types of
interaction (say) limited... for instance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ what else might they wrongly associate???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which brings me onto the question of spellings of 'hullo' -
i had an early reader as a boy where they always spelt it with a 'u', and i
could never figure out why this otherwise normal boy </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what are the key arguments for/against an innate LAD, and
surely the answer is a compromise??? y, but it&#8217;s to do with how general our
ability for acquiring language is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>interesting, if meaning is use, then it makes sense that
since &quot;the syntactic category is nothing more than a reflection of its
meaning they will not be listed separately&quot; (Altmann, pg 80)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presumably the reason why duality is a fundamental part of
language relates to Nowak et al.'s work on the need for a combinatorial system
to express a complex (e.g. object/event) view of the world - but is there a
need for (more than) two levels of duality (at the phoneme/word level, and the
word/sentence level, and even finer grains, e.g. phoneme/morpheme,
phoneme/syllable)??? what would happen if all words were uniquely
distinguishable??? that would require a LOT of syllables, or longer sentences
filled with function words, or lots of compound words (like in German)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ is this an original/innovative means of simplifying
things??? well, not so much - the animal lang experimenters do teh same by
using a fixed vocabulary of symbols - but importantly, the experimenters are
communicating in a spoken natural language and the chimps only have the
keyboard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I doubt that it's that there are a finite number of
human-universal parameters that the baby sets according to the language - not
only do I not understand how that would evolve, since you'd think that races
would just evolve towards the same chosen parameters for all the languages in
that area - rather, I think that the fact that certain conventions clump
together is an epiphenomenon of the general language-learning process - mind
you, it wasn't that conventions clump but that each language seems to make a
number of binary, arbitrary decisions that Chomsky's parameters are about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it would be very interesting to see if any of the animals
were able to manage morphology (either in ASL or spoken), since morphology and
grammar seem two similar ways of achieving the same aim</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>similarly, you could say that just as syntax specifies the
meaning of the sentence, so does spelling signal the meaning of the word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the issue of ambiguity interesting/important - it shows
that we process the sentence as we go along, but presumably there's little
ambiguity in a 3-word sentence - aha, but when they're LEARNING grammar, they
will not know whether the obj comes before or after the verb - hence the value
of knowing the meanings of the nouns so they can guess given what's happening</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we appear to try and fit agents into roles as soon as we
encounter them, and revise our assumptions later if necessary - this fits my
idea that grammar is effectively (or grew out of) the sum of all the relations
contained with reference to words in the mental lexicon - we can't deal well
with role-less words - we're doing a complicated constraint satisfaction
exercise all the time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>define the sentences my agents have in terms of their
characteristics</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ eg the lang modality being fleeting, distal,
segmented/discrete???, line of sight??? etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do i think there are added, or even diminished difficulties,
in trying to model the evolution of language in more writing-like (or
gesture-like) than speech-like modality???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how do you program in an innate representation/assumption
for the same thing not having two names???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the brain may well not have concepts in the way that we
think - the brain simply consists of a single brain state that we can
artificially try and break down and consider in discrete/component terms, but
ultimately a given concept may only be fully specifiable in terms of the
aggregate of all past/possible functional roles it could play</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mental lexicon - better analogy than the OED would be a sort
of 'What's what' biography of objects/words???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is very an adverb??? do adverbs describe verbs??? do adverbs
also describe adjectives??? is there any way in English to describe adverbs???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps the logical operators (and, not etc) would be quite
easy to learn - and from them, 'and' as a conjunction, and 'but' (and + not)
could follow. and then '-&gt;' (i.e. 'if') and then conditionals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>basically come up with my own simple grammar, which i can

neuronal activity representing continuous word-by-word input???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a 50-neuron input vector, with each neuron being just on or
off, could probably represent an enormous number of words/combinations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each word could be attached to a set of bit flags for part
of speech, plural etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the words could come in, 8 neurons or whatever at a time,
and fill up a buffer of 1000 neurons within which the entire sentence has to
fit &#8211; would that work with word order at all???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does Nowak et al.&#8217;s point about the difficulty of
communicating + storing enormous number of words work??? yes, because although
a 500-neuron binary vector = 2<sup>500</sup> = 10<sup>150</sup>, representing
is different from learning/storing/recalling and
communicating/attenuated/decoding etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Nowak, Plotkin &amp; Jansen (2000) paper excludes Alex
the grey parrot from its discussion of complex animal vocalisation. curiously,
it seems happy to define syntax in terms of (discrete, combinable) components
which have their own meaning, which surely includes Kanzi etc.???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the paper doesn&#8217;t consider pre-language, where there is no
consensus on the words &#8211; but perhaps, there was no such time. the primeval sign
language symbol for danger is running away, the symbol for hawk is looking
worriedly into the sky etc. &#8211; hence the importance of embodiment, a real
environment, a fitness function imperative to learn language that relates to a
fitness function motivating behaviour, and tying language in with the other
senses as part of the whole gamut of signals with which we communicate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how big/sharp a transition is it to go from event-based
non-syntactic language to syntactic language??? can the two co-exist to some
degree for a while??? what&#8217;s curious is that you might think that common events
would frequently be broken down into object/action pairs, but at the same time,
there&#8217;s a strong force moving frequently correlated object/action pairs towards
their own name &#8211; I think that actually it&#8217;s when you get numerous/frequent
events which contain a similar factor that they get broken down, e.g. man
running, man walking, man being scared of beast, man eating <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>Â®</span> man +
running/walking/being scared/eating etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they don&#8217;t address the verb/adjective similarity, e.g.
runningMan, man running</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does it make sense to talk of the world as containing
discrete number of objects or actions??? of course not, though the analysis is
presupposing a pre-linguistic abstraction mechanism to which the words refer. I
wonder whether it makes any difference that language shapes that abstraction
mechanism to fit its representational/communicable properties???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in fact, it implies at the end that one can (and many
animals do) have a syntactic understanding of the world without a syntactic
means of communicating</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>you can't divorce comprehension from generation - the two
are inter-related. would babies learn language if they weren't allowed to
babble, or even speak at all? no, i don't think so(???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i want to create a simple environment, with particular
entities that are all different from each other, but that i can universalise
and label. i will represent the input from the environment to my agent in an
abstracted form, but the modality might be something like a bat's sonar, or a
visual pattern, or an n-dimensional co-ordinate. needs input, but you also need
output, interaction with your environment, embodiment. if i create a rich, but
still crude, representation/modality then i don't need to worry about vision,
though language is only as complex as the environment we need to represent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leila thinks you can have a priv, internal mental language
that you can't communicate. apparently we disagree with this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in order to communicate with language, then you need a
mental representation of language. this may or may not be the same as an
internal language - leila thinks they are the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>you need consciousness in order to ascribe meaning to the
neural representations. you need consciousness in order to separate yourself
from teh environment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>excerpt from Pinker demonstrating the need for cognitive
processes underlying linguistic ones: <i>Conceptual development, too, might
affect language development: if a child has not yet mastered a difficult
semantic distinction, such as the complex temporal relations involved in John
will have gone, he or she may be unable to master the syntax of the
construction dedicated to expressing it.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there needs to be a context in which a sentence is uttered
in order for the child to eventually be able to derive meaning from sound</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if you&#8217;re going for biological plausibility, then negative
evidence shouldn&#8217;t play too strong a role in your learning &#8211; see Learnability
theorem</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can you not just use a combination of positive evidence and
a continual pruning with ockham&#8217;s razor to discern the legitimate constructions
in a language, even without negative evidence???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>language, apparently, is not quite like sight (in that you
need to coordinate your visual input relative to idiothetic signals and
voluntary action &#8211; e.g. the kitten strapped to a trolley and wheeled around who
never learned to see) (cf misc notes)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>these modalities i ascribe my agents in their evolving world
(the environment changes in terms of the features of the land, i.e. plants and
shape of the land and weather) as well as in terms of the competing enemies
(all of which should, really, see *themselves* as agents). anyway, how could i
evolve my agents language? i will give them a limited bandwidth and a set of
say 10 articulatory sounds, by which i will try to get them to evolve a LAD. by
this i mean that two agents will mutually come to ascribe a certain arbitrary
phoneme or combination of phonemes a meaning, and that eventually the continued
use of these certain phonemes in connection with certain objects/events will
cause the language community as a whole to adopt those 'words' (i.e. the usage
of those particular phonemes in a particular context). i would hope that
eventually each agent would come to be represented by a different
phoneme-combination (i.e. word, i.e. name) as well as being a member of the
overall species-group (word/name). it is only a hop, skip &amp; jump to a
noun-verb distinction. we could then see whether, over successive generations,
language became more complex (depending on whether they lived longer, whether
there were adaptive benefits to speaking it (eg pheremone trails and flocking
and group attacks)(i.e. each incremental step was both adaptive and increased
their innate linguistic aptitude), whether their neural networks could cope
with more complex language, whether their environment was hard enough to merit
it, whether the evolutionary mechanism could evolve their neural networks and
articulatory/auditory mechanisms to increase bandwidth on the part of speaker
&amp; listener), whether knowledge would be passed on to future generations by
being passed down to the next generation in speech, or even being stored in the
environment as communal memory in the form of writing, whether new languages
would develop if we take away their ears but give them expressive finger
gestures etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it all comes down to whether syntax can be represented
neurally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their lifespans should increase after a number of
generations (ideally through evolution and not being killed so much), so that
the phylogenetic improvements in language-learning (e.g. larger NNs, increased
range of speech sounds, memory, the beginnings of a specific innate LAD) are a
precursor to the ontogenetic improvements (which i hope to see demonstrated in
the model, in line with the real life ones) - first single words, then
combining words, perhaps initially in common/fixed patterns, finally in larger
phrases - it might be that a language where word order is less important than
endings will evolve, or vice versa or something new - who knows, if it works,
what sort of language (or whether i'll be able to decipher it) will emerge?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there would also be some tangential value because this would
be a truly alien language, and it would be interesting in terms of
understanding whether or not human language acquisition stems from our
general-purpose cognitive abilities learning specialised linguistic
functionality, or whether we have an innate LAD - we could study how easily
humans were able to learn this new language, relative to our little
computerised agents at different levels of linguistic evolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ideally there should be some intermediate adaptive value to
being able to articulate the phonemes, e.g. any verbalisation whatsoever could
sound like an enemy's approaching war-cry, with different vocalisations coming
to represent different enemies. from here, where though???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps this A-life experiment will investigate internal
models that the agents form, and how language and social organisation are
closely tied with trying to figure out what another agent will do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>consider chains of discrete NNs - eg a NN which specifically
gets input from one modality - but this wouldn't evolve - that would be me playing
God, which will make it harder for me to simultaneously get the NN to associate
all these separate forms of input</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they will have good ears and be short-sighted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what about if they communicate in tones, or some other
restricted discrete auditory units, rather than blended, analogue-ish???
infinitely variable acoustic signals (like human speech) &#8211; perhaps the letters
of the alphabet can be used to randomly represent their articulatory range,
from which their phonemic inventory will be drawn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i believe in a mentalese, because of the difficulties of
vocalising a thought in words, and also because an idea is somehow unitary and
on the verge of linguistic, but it is definitely represented differently to the
sequential nature of a sentence (which must be so necessarily because of the
serial stream of speech on which it depends).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>part of the reason that you can't have comprehension without
generation or vice versa might come from evidence for the motor theory of
speech perception, where we represent language in terms of the articulatory
motor signals, and so when we hear someone speak, we are translating the
auditory signal into the motor signal representationn we would need to make the
same speech sounds ourselves. in which case, learning to understand language without
being able to speak would be impossible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The proposal is that the acquisition of grammatical
relations occurs as a three-stage process. In the first stage a child learns
verb argument structures as separate, individual &#8220;mini-grammars&#8221;. This word is
used to emphasize that there are no overarching abstractions that link these
individual argument structures to other argument structures. Each argument
structure is a separate grammar unto itself. In the second stage the child
develops correspondences between the separate minigrammars; initially the
correspondences are based on both semantic and syntactic similarity, later the
correspondences are established on purely syntactic criteria. The transition is
gradual, with the role that semantics plays decreasing slowly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Â</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the third stage, the child begins to associate the
abstract arguments of the abstract transitive and intransitive constructions
with the coindexing constructions that instantiate the properties of, for
example, clause coordination, control structures, and reflexivization. So, for
example, an intransitive-to-transitive coindexing construction will associate the
S of an intransitive first clause with the deleted co-referent A of a
transitive second clause. This will enable the understanding of a sentence like
Max arrived and hugged everyone. Similarly, a transitive-to-intransitive
coindexing construction will associate the A of an initial transitive clause
with the S of a following intransitive clause; this will enable the
understanding of a sentence like Max hugged Annie and left. Since this
association takes place relatively late in the process, necessarily building on
layers of abstraction and guided by input, the grammatical relations (of which
S, A, and O are the raw material) &#8220;grow&#8221; naturally into the
language-appropriate molds. (Morris)</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc7457556">Language arena</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need an arena/environment in which my linguistic agents
can gambol - one where being able to effectively interpret, predict,
communicate and question about others' behaviour (beliefs, desires and
intentions) is particularly adaptive - they'll need at least one further
sensory modality, in fact, almost certaintly two - and a sense of space and
time, though it's possible that those emerge naturally out of the system</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why not give each agent semi-arbitrary/random digestive
systems/appetites and faculties/strengths, in a world full of different
obstacles/tasks, so that they have to work together to survive - the larger the
unit, comprising the more varied folk, the better. This will lead to speech
communities, which grow, where it would be optimal for them to aggregate
(babel-like) into one big one, but this will require them to learn to translate
between sub-specific speech communities since whenever a community dies out,
the skills lost will be automatically replaced but starting again from a random
point in the language-space</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do i need a second species??? I could have 2 species, which
cannot communicate at all whatsoever, which are designed to continually breed
to an asymptotic population maximum of the maximum the environment can sustain,
so the optimum is for one to die out completely</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ - to each according to his needs and from each
according to their desires</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To what extent will they be able to improve their physiology
of speech??? Specify in a (fairly) stable part of the genome sentence length,
word size etc. So that they get an advantage by using more complex sentences
and indeed need to use v complex sentences to be optimal in the environment,
but longer sentences are more tiring, and maybe require them to understand
place-holders - how can i ensure that the longer sentences correspond to more
generalising + powerful sentences???</p>

<h5>Possible tasks + problems requiring folk psychology + communication</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>How about playing chess, but each agent can only see part of
the board??? No. That&#8217;s crap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has to be slightly strategic and require team-work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A maze, with parts accessible/passable/dangerous
to different agents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A team sport, or a battle/war (with territories to
occupy/protect)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It needs to be scalable, and to get more difficult to
coordinate with many people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should they have limited range of earshot/visibility??? Will
it require trust, and have the potential for deception??? Yes, and altruism</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only things that can be affected by evolution are
language-related - speech production; syntactic construction + understanding;
listening capabilities; short-term linguistic memory</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Must the language be discrete combinatorial??? Smaller
units, like in music, might be easier to evolve??? With harmonies, so that each
word is a much more complicated object, allowing simple sentence constructions
but comprised of many-overtoned-vocabulary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They will have to communicate about the external world as
well &#8211; position of good/bad things, routes + directions, order people to occupy
positions, landmarks, waypoints, common events, signal predators, warn of
danger</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What if everyone has a slightly different hearing system, so
they can&#8217;t all communicate with each other, and require translators???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Better still, have a variety of populations, some of which
have complementary goals and can speak/hear at the same frequencies</p>

<h5>What senses will they have?</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone&#8217;s senses will be different</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Object position</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Recognise objects + agents</p>

<h5>How can i make this applicable to the real world?</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once i can always form a cohesive speech community, try
forcing populations to evolve towards human-like syntax (e.g.
Subject-object-verb)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Work towards being able to ask them questions and command
them about their world, using some sort of hybrid pidgin</p>

<h5>Forming representations and self-organising architectures</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Multi-modal competitive nets - lots of little competitive
nets, all working on one modality at once, and one big competitive net which is
fed them all at once, and which has bi-directional links with the little ones</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What happens if you feed an autoassociator a lot of
variables at once for long enough - does it start to form its own categories
and archetypes, or do i need a competitive net to do that???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Can you have a pattern associator with hidden nodes???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:4.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:17.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>yes, that's what backprop is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ feed a pattern associator all the info about a current
situation as training data as well as what happened after that - then when you
feed it current situational data, if the symbolic modules monitoring it thinks
it's sure enough about the resulting pattern associated, it can feed back its
prediction about what it thinks will happen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ if this works, then the hidden nodes of your
predictive pattern associator have formed an internal model!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ in order to do this, you need a suitably processed (by
this i mean 'relevant') input representation of the environment (geography,
food, shelter, weather, mating season etc., position of other
agents/prey/predators), the actions of other agents and the *internal states*
of the other agents (couched in the language of your own internal states???)
(possibly as well as of your own internal state) and you need a means of representing
the predictions - can you use the same combination of environment and
other-agent-internal-external representation ??? Yes, if the input
representation was good enough, you should certainly be able to use it as a
template for the output</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>if you have a good internal
model of how your own body will respond to a given situation, you can just copy
that module and just feed in input about <i>other</i> agents to form a model of
<i>their</i> internal states</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may need a meta-representation of your own internal
states to use as part of your template for the internal states of other agents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ eventually, the hope is that all the agents will
evolve to voice their own internal states so that the other agents can more
easily form representations of each other's internal states, by correlating
'hungry' with eating food soon after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ how do you base one representation on another???
Simply copy its organisation and then feed it new data??? Teach it from
scratch???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are lots of things we don't yet know how to do in
connectionist terms but which we have no a priori reason for thinking cannot be
done - why not just use symbolic modules as placeholders in the interim???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ this is the logic behind backprop nets - in fact, it
may make sense to use backprop modules instead of symbolic modules a lot of the
time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ now, let's say i've got a backprop net doing a vital
job in my network and i want to move towards biological plausibility - what can
i do??? Am i stuck with it??? It's learned a bunch of weights - i could encode
them in the genome i spose, but that's no fun...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>perhaps I could encode some of
the weights in the genome, and figure out different ways of encoding it more
efficiently &#8211; but I might have to do that externally and then artificially
graft it back into my experiment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It may be that having a symbolic module will be most useful
in memory-related functions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shouldn't be too upset at having to make backprop nets
integral to my design, given that i was inspired in the first place by the idea
of chaining lots of them together, and it may be that i can somehow encode
their organisation in compressed form in the genome, perhaps by getting a
pattern associator to look at a report of their inputs/outputs/connectivity
after the event???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Better still, i could sort out a
working agent, then keep everything else static, and figure out how to grow
that function using biologically plausible genetic/developmental tricks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Is there any evidence against the
idea that early early animals specified connectivity at a pretty low level in
the genome???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why not go for super-plasticity &#8211; when you want to try and
predict something, you generate a whole load of new spaces (mostly based on
groups you have for representing things) and try them all out and see which
one(s) is best for the new thing you want to represent, and just keep that one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Why not go for a lamarckian system
&#8211; if you find a good representation, use a meta-nn to encode it in your genome
and all your descendants will have it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>This is the advantage of using
your genome to structure your agent. The hard part is figuring out how your
meta-nn can encode/compress it into the genome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Having said that, you can have
quite a flexible genome &#8211; it can contain explicit, specific, weight-by-weight
(user-hand-coded or self-copies of a self-organised module) connectivity, a
broad connectivity formula, a spatial location from which to grow, parameters
for basic architectures (e.g. 5-output competitive net etc.), prewired timing
for flowering and pruning, a complete training set (fuck it, why not!),
backprop, symbolic modules, copies of working modules to that don&#8217;t start to
grow until adolescence, the types/properties of that group&#8217;s neurons</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>How are the broad connectivity
formulae going to be encoded in the genome???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Misc</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>I reckon that language piggybacks, like the tip of an
iceberg, on top of a whole host of perceptual + cognitive systems. Surely
though, all it really needs is the various outputs (and intermediate processing
levels in some cases too), which it can form together. After all, what&#8217;s so
different about language from any other abstract, multi-modal representation
(based on the same information)??? (this is why i&#8217;m happy to try and play
around with language without having solved every other lower level problem
first)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Well, it&#8217;s defined in terms of the
type of output it needs to produce, which is defined by its function -
communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can kind of imagine how a speech community will form.
They&#8217;ll be wired up to spontaneously produce sounds to begin with (kind of like
babies going &#8216;ga-ga&#8217;), especially in response to things. The early generations&#8217;
genome will be designed to produce probably one-word utterances. But they&#8217;ll
simultaneously be listening out for other people&#8217;s, especially if they
correlate with their own, and when that happens, they&#8217;ll look to see what was
going on in the world when they both said the same thing. This will lead to
speech communities formed around the same sensory system &#8211; ok, well then, we&#8217;ll
have to make sure that even if they have different
limbs/abilities/strengths/intelligences and different needs/desires/appetite
levels, they still share senses. Indeed, this makes sense. This is what quine
was talking about with observation sentences again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:17.85pt'>it makes especially sense if the
babbling is somehow (a little bit) systematically linked to their internal
state or sensory input or something, e.g. perhaps we&#8217;re wired up to squeal when
we&#8217;re in sudden pain which could be conventionalised into a word for pain like
&#8216;ow&#8217; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem it looks as though they&#8217;ll come up against at
every stage of language learning + building is how the community (or really
even just two &#8211; or even one??? - individuals) agree on a new
definition/structure, e.g. If they start uttering just one word, how will they
move to 2 words (with different parts of speech, say)???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Perhaps the idea of words as
harmonies will help here, because then you can associate both (simultaneous)
sounds with the same event</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>In this case, they won&#8217;t be so
much words as parallel (rather than serial/sequential) sentences</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Kind of like a huge multi-morpheme
word or a german compound noun</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>In fact, is there any difference
between harmonies and adding morphemes to a stem??? Well, suffixes, prefixes
and infixes tend to contain less meaning than whole other words</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>However, they do allow for more subtle
changes, rather than inventing a whole new word/harmony line, you can just move
a tiny bit in conceptual space (e.g. By changing the part of speech of a word
but retaining its semantic significance, e.g. Greg<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>/</span>greg&#8217;s,
high<span style='font-size:10.0pt'>/</span>height)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of what we&#8217;re investigating here is the idea of a
conceptual scheme, and how relativised to our sensory system this is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should i accept that i&#8217;m trying to do way too fucking much,
especially with the whole folk psychology thing, societies and trust, and
fucking language on top of it all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could throw in a helpless not-very-bright
evolutionarily-static symbiotic population who can&#8217;t fend for themselves very
well but are necessary in the ecosystem in some way, so the agents have to
learn to protect and care for them &#8211; and this may ultimately require
communicating with them &#8211; and these agents will use human words like &#8216;food&#8217; and
&#8216;hungry&#8217;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>So by giving the helpless
symbiotic species more and more human-like vocab and grammar, we can build an
intertranslatory bridge to the agents&#8230; and the beauty is that they&#8217;ll be
translating into <i>our</i> language&#8230; but they won&#8217;t be innovating in our
language &#8211; how do i make them switch themselves permanently to english over
time???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The problem is that even if they
learn words like &#8216;food&#8217; and &#8216;pain&#8217;, we can&#8217;t use the same techniques for really
teaching them english, because if we embody them in the real world we won&#8217;t be
able to use massive populations being selected for linguistic competence as the
drive to learn the language any more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Unless you could use the a-life
simulation to put them in lots of different environments, growing more and more
similar to the real world, and forcing them to learn lots of languages and be
good at it and enjoy it and develop a reward system for learning new languages,
while making the helpless symbiotic population use more and more advanced
english (of course, this will have to be pre-programmed)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Even with a limited training set,
they might conceivably be able to generalise basic human (&lt; 5 word) syntax,
on the basis of different constructions with the same meaning (e.g. &#8216;i am
hungry&#8217;, &#8216;greg is hungry&#8217; and &#8216;i want food&#8217;)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>This requires a really fucking high
level module that abstracts away from the actual sentence construction used to
its <i>meaning</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>We&#8217;re back to minsky&#8217;s idea of
meaning as a multi-faceted representation (that feeds back on itself, e.g.
Using our output representation as input representation???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are they going to output sequences of words, i.e.
Sentences??? Will they have a fixed number of word output slots/sentence???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps they will need some sort of auditory stream that
they have to disambiguate, forcing them to parse the speech input data in some
way, form multiple possible trees, and choose the most likely one???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Birdseedland</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>so-called because of the adverts with squirrels doing
mammoth obstacle courses to get the birdseed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>imagine them being placed in front of arches, in groups -
pressing the red square opens the door, pressing the blue one lets them escape,
pressing the green one reveals the red one etc - perhaps they have to do them
in sequence, or at the same time, requiring them to cooperate with each other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ perhaps there are occasionally predators, and one has
to be on guard to let them all flee in time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ or they could be on a train with these test-arches
passing by - maybe this is a way of avoiding space, but keeping time - perhaps
some of them have restricted time-limits and so they have to be in place
beforehand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ how can i visualise what it would be like to have no
spatial sense - think back to strawson's auditory Hero</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ if some of them can't see the whole arch, then they'll
need to question/communicate what they do see, and come up with a plan</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>alternatively, the agent could be replicated before being
allowed to practise with the arch for a while, then it has to communicate to
its ignorant self what to do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the problem is that all this shit requires it to learn words
associated with each object, and actions, questions, causation big-time, and
the need to communicate it to its mate as well as figuring out the necessary
sequence - TOO HARD, and it's not even considering space - how am i ever going
to get rid of causality??? perhaps it's just part of a minimum-iceberg, esp. if
all the other bits have been excluded too - after all, if you haven't got a cognitive
iceberg at all, then literally all you have is stimulus-response/associative
conditioning, which we all know can't do the job</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if i replace NN bits with symbolic algorithms, what do i
lose??? after all, they can be plugged back in, and back-project their results
and stuff. but they don't learn. but i don't know how to get big cognitive NN
modules to learn goals and stuff anyway, so ...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i'm worried that maybe i'm going to have problems teaching
them nouns from day one - cos if i say 'redsquare' to them every time they see
a redsquare, and reward them for babbling 'redsquare' back, will they continue
to do that without the prompt??? let's say the anwswer is yes. if i still
reward them when they say 'redsquare' every time they see one, without the pre-emptive
voice prompt, that's cheating, but maybe necessary. anyway, they learn the
words for 5 different objects like that. maybe i also need to teach them to say
'redsquare' and press it at the same time somehow. ok. somehow. no no no, it's
all confused, about learning the name for it, learning to press it, learning
the name to press it, learning to produce that name for it etc. how about if
their motor system has a bunch of different pre-programmed options, including
:say 'redsquare', press the red square, say 'press' etc. then i teach them
'press redsquare' and 'say redsquare' as different actions for the same object.

prospective word has been used (and in the context it thinks i'm writing in),
whether it seems like a proper english word (in terms of statistically matching
letter pairings/triplets etc.), whether the keys i've mixed up are close
together (and whether the letters are inverted, key missed out/double pressed
etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>while not at the goal pick a direction to move toward the
goal if that direction is clear for movement move there else pick another
direction according to an avoidance strategy </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there a way we can combine the comprehensible rules-based
(often human encoded) symbolic AI approach with the non-ruled adaptive
incomprehensible NNs??? that wouldn't be biologically plausible though. could i
write a program to decode NNs, perhaps by running through hundreds of
simulations and somehow cataloguing the results (i.e. reverse engineering the
results, so that i could have an NN whose workings i could understand, or at
least the results of the working anyway) - but the whole point is that NNs
don't have rules per se, eg the NNs that are more successulf for learning both
regular and irregular words because they don't rely on either one or the other
rule, but constraint satisfaction in some way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>second order neural network - you use a neural network to
determine the growth, development and organisation of the first order net - you
want a NN to solve a complex path-finding problem, so you train your second
order NN on other NNs that have proven successful at their tasks, by showing it
the input data, the required output data and the NNs themselves. then you use
that second order NN to organise others. it's not how the brain develops, but
with each stage/order of evolution/neural net, you jack up the order or power
of abstraction and self-organisation of the environet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>human mind is able to use the environment as a means of
storing information - e.g. writing and talking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understanding = knowing about the application of a rule.
being able to apply the rule yourself, as well as being able to recognise
legitimate and complicated applications of the rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>intelligence = learned, goal-directed (alive), measurable by
the complexity of the chain of reasoning (the number of steps/obstacles between
the current state and the state you want to be in)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>quake family or perhaps a single modular agent comprised of
different body parts/functions, which need to communicate to each other. its NN
learns to make sense of the visual input, and to form an internal model of the
environment, and learns what 'forward' or 'shoot' mean in terms of what it can
understand. from this, abstract to 'movement', 'pain', 'hide' etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how can dennett explain blindsight? surely there must be
something specific about the various neural paths/tracks which makes some of
them conscious, and some not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>coarse coding = distributed? sparse? linear? random

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could we not get a drug which simply speeded up long-term
potentiation in certain areas of the brain - the ones to do with formation of
concepts ...?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i'm going to have a glossary with various ways of explaining
the same thing, canvassed f diff sources</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what is the problem with epiphenomenonalism, ie what is
wrong with the idea that the mental is inert?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what makes up me, ie my peculiar brain processes and neural
make-up is preserved - it is simply that the decision-making is going on at the
physical, neural level and perceived in mental terms, rather than the mental
directing the physical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i can be a functionalist, and just say that (though i have
no idea how) my program will have phenomenological experience</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does Dijkstra's algorithm necessarily find the best path?
does it analyse every single node in terrain? do you need to look at every node
in the terrain to be sure of finding the best path? or only if there are patchy
terrain costs?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what difference does it make to our choice/power of
algorithm if we do/don't know where the goal is and/or what obstacles are in
the way, or shroud as in C&amp;C?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>_____ prioritise the choice of algorithm, so that it fits
the best knowledge it has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trade-off also as to how fast we want to find a solution vs
how good a path it is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what if we're also trying to avoid something, or there's
gravity?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what happens if the terrain affects acceleration, as well as
top speed? :)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can we get a good sliding scale of efficiency by slapping

<p class=MsoNormal>is the difference tween man/animal emotion (according to
Damasio) that we have the conscious evaluative mech, and similarly, that we
have the landscape/foreground body state/thought content 'feeling' which can go
alongside</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for it to answer intelligently, there has to be some sort of
intelligence behind it - for that, it has to understand, and have purpose (and
obstacles)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for it to understand, it must first comprehend
syntactically, then compare semantically with knowledgebase</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it has access to infinite reading material</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but i do not have infinite time/resources(/expertise) - so

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by first limiting the requirements/demands/topics it has to

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ned block describes physicalism as a kind of subset of
