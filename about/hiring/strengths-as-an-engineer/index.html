<h2>Languages, tools and frameworks</h2>
<p>Highly fluent in Python/Django, SQL, HTML/CSS/Javascript/ jQuery.</p>
<p>Also: Unix sysadmin, Matlab, Lisp, C++ and various other languages/platforms.</p>
<h2>Experienced</h2>
<p>I've worked on a wide variety of software projects, with different constraints and goals (build it accurately vs build it quick vs build it beautifully).</p>
<p>I'm comfortable working in various environments: in small teams and alone; on long-term self-defined research goals; and also on urgent, high-pressure engineering goals.</p>
<p>Hardwon experience in software architecture, database tuning, rapid design iteration, data mining, algorithm development, continuous deployment, test-driven development, AB testing, web analytics, visualization, product development, user-generated content, game design, managing remote employees, hiring.</p>
<h2>Where I really shine</h2>
<p>I have really good high-level judgment about architecture and tools. I weigh up tradeoffs well, and I'm a great person to bounce ideas off before actually starting to code. I can save people a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<p>I much prefer back-end to front-end development.</p>
<p>Much of my PhD involved running experiments, heavy data mining and weird visualizations, so I love AB testing and analytics.</p>
<p>I like building tools to make development more efficient. I care about good software engineering practices (testing, continuous deployment, pair programming, good documentation).</p>
<p>I'm a really good communicator (speaking, writing, discussing), so I enjoy working as a bridge between technical and non-technical parts of the team.</p>
