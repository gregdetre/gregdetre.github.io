questions:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Conant’s excellent 
point was that in the history of philosophy, up to this very day, we often find 
philosophers talking past each other because they don’t see the difference 
between the Cartesian question (or family of questions) and the Kantian question 
(or family of questions), or because they try to merge the questions. I want to 
add a third version of the question:<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

A team wins, but I don’t think it is <I>obvious</I>. In fact, I think it takes a 
rather remarkable exercise of the imagination to see how it might even be 
possible, but I do think one can present a powerful case for it. As I like to 
put it, <I>we </I>are robots made of robots–we’re each composed of some few 
trillion robotic cells, each one as mindless as the molecules they’re composed 
of, but working together in a gigantic team that creates <I>all the action</I> 
that occurs in a conscious agent. Turing’s great contribution was to show us 
that Kant’s question could be recast as an <I>engineering </I>question. Turing 
showed us how we could trade in the first-person perspective of Descartes and 
Kant for the third-person perspective of the natural sciences and <I>answer all 
the questions</I>–without philosophically significant residue.

</SPAN>David Chalmers is the captain of the B team, (along with Nagel, Searle, 
Fodor, Levine, Pinker, Harnad and many others). He insists that he just 
<I>knows</I> that the A team leaves out consciousness.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It doesn’t address what Chalmers calls 
the Hard Problem. How does he know? He says he just does. He has a gut 
intuition, something he has sometimes called “direct experience.” I know the 
intuition well. I can feel it myself. When I put up Turing’s proposal just now, 
if you felt a little twinge, a little shock, a sense that your pocket had just 
been picked, you know the feeling too. I call it the Zombic Hunch (Dennett, 
forthcoming). I feel it, but I don’t credit it. I figure that Turing’s genius 
permitted him to see that we can <I>leap over</I> the Zombic Hunch. We can come 
to see it, in the end, as a misleader, a roadblock to understanding. We’ve 
learned to dismiss other such intuitions in the past–the obstacles that so long 
prevented us from seeing the Earth as revolving around the sun, or seeing that 
living things were composed of non-living matter. It still <I>seems</I> that the 
sun goes round the earth, and it still <I>seems</I> that a living thing has some 
extra spark, some extra ingredient that sets it apart from all non-living stuff, 
but we’ve learned not to credit those intuitions. So now, do you want to join me 
in leaping over the Zombic Hunch, or do you want to stay put, transfixed by this 
intuition that won’t budge?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I will 
try to show you how to join me in making the leap. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

objective physical science and its insistence on the third-person point of view, 
to a method of phenomenological description that can (in principle) do justice 
to the most private and ineffable subjective experiences, while never abandoning 
the methodological principles of science. (<I>CE</I>,

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">How does it 
work?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We start with recorded raw 
data. Among these are the vocal sounds people make (what they say, in other 
words), but to these verbal reports must be added all the other manifestations 
of belief, conviction, expectation, fear, loathing, disgust, etc.,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>including any and all internal 
conditions (e.g. brain activities, hormonal diffusion, heart rate changes, etc.) 
detectable by objective means. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I guess I should take some of the blame for the misapprehension, in some 
quarters, that heterophenomenology <I>restricts itself</I> to verbal reports. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Verbal reports are different from all 
other sorts of raw data precisely in that they admit of (and require, according 
to both heterophenomenology and the 1<SUP>st</SUP>-person point of view) 
interpretation as speech acts, and subsequent assessment as expressions of 
belief about a subject’s “private” subjective state. And so my discussion of the 
methodology focused on such verbal reports in order to show how they are 
captured within the fold of standard scientific (“3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person”) data. 
But all other such data, all behavioral reactions, visceral reactions, hormonal 
reactions, and other changes in physically detectable state are included within 
heterophenomenology. I thought that went without saying, but apparently these 
additional data are often conveniently overlooked by critics of 
heterophenomenology.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>From the recorded verbal utterances, we get transcripts (e.g., in English 
or French, or whatever), from which in turn we devise interpretations of the 
subjects’ speech acts, which we thus get to treat as (apparent) expressions of 
their beliefs, on all topics. Thus using the intentional stance (Dennett, 1971, 
1987), we construct therefrom the subject’s heterophenomenological world. We 
move, that is, from <I>raw</I> data to<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN><I>interpreted</I> data: a catalogue of the subjects’ convictions, 
beliefs, attitudes, emotional reactions, . . . (together with much detail 
regarding the circumstances in which these intentional states are situated), but 
then we adopt a special move, which distinguishes heterophenomenology from the 
normal interpersonal stance: the subjects’ beliefs (etc.) <I>are all bracketed 
for neutrality</I>. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

</SPAN>Why? Because of two failures of overlap, which we may label false 
positive and false negative. False positive: Some beliefs that subjects have 
about their own conscious states are provably false, and hence what needs 
explanation in these cases is the <I>etiology of the false 
belief</I>.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For instance, most 
people–naive people–think their visual fields are roughly uniform in visual 
detail or grain all the way out to the periphery. Even sophisticated cognitive 
scientists can be startled when they discover just how poor their capacity is to 
identify a peripherally located object (such as a playing card held at arm’s 
length). It certainly <I>seems </I>as if our visual consciousness is detailed 
all the way out all the time, but easy experiments show that it isn’t. (Our 
color vision also seems to extend all the way out, but similar experiments show 
that it doesn’t.)<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So the question 
posed by the heterophenomenologist is:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<P class=MsoNormal><I><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">not

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">False negative: Some 
<I>psychological things that happen in people</I> (to put it crudely but 
neutrally) are <I>unsuspected by those people</I>.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>People not only <I>volunteer </I>no 
information on these topics; when provoked to search, they <I>find</I> no 
information on these topics. But a forced choice guess, for instance, reveals 
that nevertheless, there is something psychological going on. This shows, for 
instance, that they <I>are</I> being influenced by the meaning of the masked 
word even though they are, as they put it, entirely unaware of any such word. 
(One might put this by saying that there is a lot of unconscious mental 
activity–but this is tendentious; to some, it might be held to beg the vexed 
question of whether people are briefly conscious of these evanescent and elusive 
topics, but just hugely and almost instantaneously forgetful of them.)

</SPAN>Now faced with these failures of overlap–people who believe they are 
conscious of more than is in fact going on in them, and people who do not 
believe they are conscious of things that are in fact going on in 
them–heterophenomenology maintains a nice neutrality: it characterizes their 
beliefs, their heterophenomenological world, without passing judgment, and then 
investigates to see what could explain <I>the existence of those beliefs</I>. 
Often, indeed typically or normally, the existence of a belief is explained by 
confirming that it is a <I>true</I> belief provoked by the normal operation of 
the relevant sensory, perceptual, or introspective systems. Less often, beliefs 
can be seen to be true only under some arguable metaphorical interpretation–the 
subject claims to have manipulated a mental image, and we’ve found a 
quasi-imagistic process in his brain that can support that claim, if it is

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This is an appealing 
idea, but it is simply a mistake. First of all, remember that 
heterophenomenology gives you much more data than just a subject’s verbal 
judgments; every blush, hesitation, and frown, as well as all the covert, 
internal reactions and activities that can be detected, are included in our 
primary data. But what about this concern with leaving the “conscious 
experiences themselves” out of the primary data? Defenders of the first-person 
point of view are not entitled to this complaint against heterophenomenology, 
since <I>by their own lights,</I> they should prefer heterophenomenology’s 
treatment of the primary data to any other. Why? Because it does justice to both 
possible sources of non-overlap. On the one hand, if some of your conscious 
experiences occur unbeknownst to you (if they are experiences about which you 
have no beliefs, and hence can make no "verbal judgments"), then they are just 
as inaccessible to your first-person point of view as they are to 
heterophenomenology. <I>Ex hypothesi</I>, you don't even suspect you have 
them--if you did, you could verbally express those suspicions. So 
heterophenomenology's list of primary data doesn't leave out any conscious 
experiences you know of, or even have any first-person inklings about. On the 
other hand, unless you claim not just reliability but outright infallibility, 
you should admit that some--just some--of your beliefs (or verbal judgments) 
about your conscious experiences might be wrong. In all such cases, however rare 
they are, what has to be explained by theory is not the conscious experience, 
but your belief in it (or your sincere verbal judgment, etc). So 
heterophenomenology doesn't include any spurious "primary data" either, but 
plays it safe in a way you should approve. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I certainly would 
play the role of reformer if it were necessary, but Goldman is simply mistaken; 
the adoption of agnosticism is so firmly built into practice these days that it 
goes without saying, which is perhaps why he missed it. Consider, for instance, 
the decades-long controversy about mental imagery, starring Shepard, Kosslyn, 
and Pylyshyn among many others. If agnosticism were not the tacit order of the 
day, Kosslyn would have never needed to do his well-known experiments to support 
subjects’ claims that what they were doing (at least if described 
metaphorically)<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>really was a 
process of image manipulation. (The issues are not settled yet, of course.) In 
psychophysics, the use of signal detection theory has been part of the canon 
since the 1960s, and it specifically commands researchers to control for the 
fact that the response criterion is under the subject’s control although the 
subject is not himself or herself a reliable source on the topic. Or consider 
the voluminous research literature on illusions, both perceptual and cognitive, 
which standardly assumes that the data are what subjects <I>judge </I>to be the 
case, and <I>never</I> makes the mistake of “relying substantially on subjects’ 
introspective beliefs.”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The 
diagnosis of Goldman’s error is particularly clear here: of course experimenters 
on illusions rely on subjects’ introspective beliefs (as expressed in their 
judgments) about <I>how it seems to them, </I>but that <I>is</I> the agnosticism 
of heterophenomenology; to go beyond it would be, for instance, to assume that 
in size illusions <I>there really were visual images of different sizes 
somewhere in subjects’ brains (or minds)</I>, which of course no researcher 
would dream of doing. Finally, consider such phenomena as <I>déja vu. </I>Sober 
research on this topic has never made the mistake of abandoning<I> 
</I>agnosticism about subjects’ claims to be reliving previous experiences. See, 
e.g., Bower and Clapper, in Posner, ed., 1989, for instance, or any good 
textbook on methods in cognitive science for the details. (Goldman has responded

</SPAN>A bounty of excellent heterophenomenological research has been done, is 
being done, on consciousness. See, e.g., the forthcoming special issue of 
<I>Cognition</I>, edited by Stanislas Dehaene, on the cognitive neuroscience of 
consciousness. It contains a wealth of recent experiments all conducted within 
the methodological strictures of heterophenomenology, whose resolutely 
third-person treatment of belief attribution squares perfectly with standard 
scientific method: when we assess the attributions of belief relied upon by 
experimenters (in preparing and debriefing subjects, for instance) we use 
precisely the principles of the intentional stance to settle what it is 
reasonable to postulate regarding the subjects’ beliefs and desires. Now 
Chalmers has objected (in the debate) that this “behavioristic” treatment of 
belief is itself question-begging against an alternative vision of belief in 
which, for instance, “having a phenomenological belief doesn’t involve just a 
pattern of responses, but often requires having certain experiences.” (personal 
correspondence, 2/19/01). On the contrary, heterophenomenology is neutral on 
just this score, for surely we mustn’t <I>assume</I> that Chalmers is right that 
there <I>is</I> a special category of “phenomenological” beliefs–that there is a 
kind of belief that is off-limits to “zombies” but not to us conscious folks. 
Heterophenomenology allows us to proceed with our catalogue of a subject’s 
beliefs leaving it open whether any or all of them are Chalmers-style 
phenomenological beliefs or mere zombie-beliefs. (More on this later.) In fact, 
heterophenomenology permits science to get on with the business of accounting 
for the patterns in all these subjective beliefs without stopping to settle this 
imponderable issue. And surely Chalmers must admit that the patterns in these 
beliefs are among the phenomena that any theory of consciousness must 
explain.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

this case, that since they never imagined such a phenomenon was possible, they 
never considered how their use of the term “qualia” should describe it. They 
discover a heretofore unimagined flaw in their concept of qualia–rather like the

mess<I>. </I>Philosophers don’t even agree on how to apply it in dramatic cases 
like this.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I hate to be an old 
I-told-you-so but I told you so (“Quining Qualia”). This should be at least 
mildly embarrassing to our field, since so many scientists have recently been 
persuaded by philosophers that they should take qualia seriously–only to 
discover that philosophers don’t come close to agreeing among themselves about 
<I>when</I> qualia<I>–whatever</I> they are–are present. (I have noticed that 
many scientists who think they are newfound friends of qualia turn out to use 
the term in ways no self-respecting qualophile will countenance.)<SPAN

</SPAN>But although some philosophers may now concede that they aren’t so sure 
what they meant by “qualia” all along, others are very sure what concept of 
qualia they’ve been using all along, so let’s consider what they say. Some of 
them, I have learned, have <I>no</I> <I>problem</I> with the idea that their 
very own qualia could change radically without their noticing. <I>They</I> mean 
by “qualia” something to which their 1<SUP>st</SUP>-person access is variable 
and problematic. If you are one of those, then heterophenomenology is your 
preferred method, since it, unlike the first-person point of view, can actually 
study the question of whether qualia change in this situation.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It is going to be a matter of some 
delicacy, however, how to <I>decide</I> which brain events count for what. In 
this phenomenon of change blindness for color changes, for instance, we know 
that the color-sensitive cones in the relevant region of your retina were 
flashing back and forth, in perfect synchrony with the white/brown quadrangle, 
and presumably (we should check) other, later areas of your color vision system 
were also shifting in time with the external color shift. But if we keep 
looking, we will also presumably find yet other areas of the visual system that 
only come into synchrony after you’ve noticed. (such effects have been found in 
similar fMRI studies, eg. O’Craven <I>et al. </I>1997).<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The hard part will be deciding (on what grounds?) which features of which 
states to declare to be qualia and why. I am not saying there can’t be grounds 
for this. I can readily imagine there being <I>good</I> grounds, but if so, then 
those will be grounds for adopting/endorsing a 3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person concept of 
qualia (cf. the discussion of Chase and Sanborn in Dennett, 1988, or the 
beer-drinkers in CE 395-6). The price you have to pay for obtaining the 
<I>support</I> of 3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person science for your conviction about how it 
is/was with you is straightforward: you have to grant that <I>what you mean</I>

either support or show to be mistaken.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Once we adopt any such concept of qualia, for instance, we will be in a 
position to answer the question of whether color qualia shift during change 
blindness. And if some subjects in our apparatus tell us that their qualia do 
shift, while our brainscanner data shows clearly that they don’t, we’ll treat 
these subjects as simply wrong <I>about their own qualia</I>, and we’ll explain

</SPAN>Here is the dilemma for the B Team, and Captain Chalmers. If you eschew 
incorrigibility claims, and especially if you acknowledge the competence of 
3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person science to answer questions that can’t be answered from 
the 1<SUP>st</SUP>-person point of view, your position collapses into 
heterophenomenology. The only remaining alternative, C(2a), is unattractive for 
a different reason. You can protect qualia from heterophenomenological 
appropriation, but only at the cost of declaring them outside science 
altogether. If qualia are so shy they are not even accessible from the 
1<SUP>st</SUP>-person point of view, then no 1<SUP>st</SUP>-person science of 
qualia is possible either. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

the impossibility of accessing all of our experience at once, and the consequent 
possibility of "grand illusions"; and more. I don't have much that's new to say

consciousness in these phenomena. That is utterly false, of course; these very 
phenomena were, after all, parade cases for heterophenomenology in 
<I>Consciousness Explained. </I>It is important to remember that the burden of 
heterophenomenology is to explain, in the end, every pattern discoverable in the 
heterophenomenological worlds of subjects; it is precisely these patterns that 
make these phenomena striking, so heterophenomenology is clearly the best 
methodology for investigating these phenomena and testing theories of them.

</SPAN>I find it ironic that while Chalmers has made something of a mission of 
trying to convince scientists that they must abandon 3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person 
science for 1<SUP>st</SUP>-person science, when asked to recommend some avenues 
to explore, he falls back on the very work that I showcased in my account of how 
to study human consciousness empirically from the 3<SUP>rd</SUP>-person point of 
view. Moreover, it is telling that none of the work on consciousness that he has 
mentioned favorably addresses his so-called Hard Problem in any fashion; it is 
all concerned, quite appropriately, with what he insists on calling the easy 
problems. First-person science of consciousness is a discipline with no methods, 
no data, no results, no future, no promise. It will remain a fantasy.

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Goldman: First, a 
brief substantive reply to your points [see above, p5].<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When cognitive scientists rely on 
subjects' reports about visual illusions, I take them to be relying on the 
veracity of the Ss' judgments (beliefs) about how the stimuli <I>look</I> 
(etc.).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That is, after all, what 
the Ss presumably say, or can be interpreted as saying:<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>"It looks as if such&#8209;and&#8209;such".<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And the cognitive scientist takes that 
to be true, i.e., that it does <I>look</I> that way to the S (roughly at the 
time of report).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Similarly, the 
cognitive scientist obviously does not conclude that Ss who report a deja vu 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">experience really 
did have the same type of experience in his/her past.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That could not be ascertained by the 
subject by introspection, which is restricted to present events.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So even if the S's deja vu report 
implies that he/she believes that a certain event or experience occurred in the 
<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">past (I am not sure 
it does imply this), the cognitive scientist does not rely on the accuracy of 
this belief.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, the cognitive 
scientist (also) takes the S to report, and to believe, that he/she is currently 
having a "seems&#8209;like&#8209;this&#8209;happened&#8209;to&#8209;me&#8209;in&#8209;the past" experience.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And the cognitive scientist <I>does</I> 
trust the S's report of <I>that</I>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>In other words, the scientist concludes that the S does have (roughly at 
the time of report) an experience of the type "seems&#8209;like&#8209;this&#8209; happened&#8209; 
to&#8209;me&#8209;in&#8209;the&#8209;past".<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As your discussion below indicates (and

auditory state, or other "perceptual&#8209;phenomenal" state.<SPAN

interjected:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>EXACTLY! They don't 
have to commit themselves to anything like that. They can remain neutral. My 
example of mental images in the brain was just a fr'instance. My point was that 
to go beyond heterophenomenological agnosticism, they'd have to suppose 
something was implied by their S's judgments (beyond the bare fact that these 
were their judgments, which is what heterophenomenology happily allows). Now it 
MAY be that your point about "perceptual&#8209;phenomenal" states that go beyond 
"mere" belief&#8209;states will someday be supported somehow. But in the meantime, 
cognitive science proceeds along merrily, leaving itself strictly neutral about 
that. And in at least some instances (for instance, sudden hunches of déja vu) 
the claim that there is anything "perceptual&#8209;phenomenal" about the presentiment 
over and above the inclination so to judge seems particularly dubious. (Ask 
yourself what deja vu would be like if it didn't have any so&#8209;called "phenomenal" 
stuffing. Isn't that in fact what it is like?) But in any case, cognitive 
science can and should (and does!) remain strictly neutral about such questions 
of phenomenality until the case is clearly made. My point for years is that it 
never has been made, so it counts, so far, as just a set of tempting hunches 
(versions of the Zombic Hunch) that cognitive science should also be agnostic 
about. And I know of no research in cognitive science that has violated that 
neutrality except by accident. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></I></P>

opinions.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Moreover, if<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>subjects were to offer their views about 
what happens (at the micro&#8209;level) when they parse a sentence or retrieve an

Fine. And isn't it nice that heterophenomenology can proceed with all of its 
research agenda without our having to settle anything about this "big issue" 
first! If you're right, the "categorical" features will eventually be confirmed 
to be important by some as yet unimagined test. (Or if, as I gather your 
colleague David Chalmers holds, no empirical or "behavioral" test could shed any 
light on this important but elusive sort of feature, I guess it will have to be 
some philosophical argument alone that settles the issue. Seems unlikely in the 
extreme to me.) In the meantime, a 3rd&#8209;person science of consciousness can 
proceed apace. That's what is so good about its 
neutrality.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></I></P>

credence to the subject's report?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Or do you deny this?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>If you 
agree that they do this, the question arises as to whether this is "neutrality", 
or agnosticism.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think not.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most epistemologists would agree that 
all of our sources of belief or justification are subject to correction from 
other sources.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We don't trust 
vision uncritically, or memory, etc., etc.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>But to say this is not to say that we are "agnostic" toward vision or 
memory.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>By giving prima facie 
credibility to each of these sources, we are doing the most that we ever do to 
any one source (or any one deliverance of a particular source).<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I would argue that the same holds 
here.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Although the scientist does 
not uncritically trust a S's introspection (and there's an additional factor 
here &#8209;&#8209; the S's report might not stem from introspection at all), he does give 
it prima facie trust.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And that is 
very far from agnosticism.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So if 
heterophenomenology ascribes true agnosticism to scientists, as you claim it 
does, then it doesn't get matters right. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal><I><SPAN style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">DENNETT REPLY: As 
I try to make clear in CE, in the section entitled "The Discreet Charm of the 
Anthropologist,” (pp82&#8209;3, on "Feenoman") heterophenomenology is NOT the NORMAL 
interpersonal relationship with which we treat others' beliefs&#8209;&#8209;with its 
presumption of truth (marked by the willingness of the interlocutor to argue 
against it, to present any evidence believed to run counter, etc). That is also 
true of anthropologists' relationships with their subjects when investigating 
such things as their religion. Actually, it extends quite far&#8209;&#8209;when the native 
informants are telling the anthropologists about, say, their knowledge of the 
healing powers of the local plants, the anthropologists' first concern is to get 
the lore, true or false &#8209;&#8209;something to be investigated further later. Ditto for 
heterophenomenology: get the lore, as neutrally and sympathetically as possible. 
That is a kind of agnosticism, differing in the ways I detail on pp82&#8209;3 from the 
normal interpersonal stance, but it is the normal researcher/subject 
relationship when studying consciousness with the help of S's protocols. If it 
doesn't fit your (or a dictionary's, or the majority of epistemologists’) 
definition of agnosticism perfectly, I have at least made clear just what kind 
of agnosticism it is, and why it is the way it is.<SPAN

it is what it is&#8209;&#8209;and then I've given it an unwieldy name. So when, in my 
forthcoming Cognition essay, in the special issue on the cognitive neuroscience 
of consciousness, I point out that the hundreds of experiments discussed in the

referees nod in agreement. Of course. It's just science, after all. And it does
