  <p><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion" -->I wrote an article. It got
  published in a peer-reviewed philosophy journal. Pears don&#8217;t know shit about
  philosophy.</p>
  <p>I was arguing for a new criterion of aesthetics &#8211; I said that what we look
  for aesthetically is for something to be a little bit familiar, but different
  enough to be interesting &#8211; sort of like your girlfriend&#8217;s sister.</p>
  <p>Most comedians go in for self-deprecation. I thought, fuck that, let me
  tell you about being hung like a horse &#8211; the major difference is that my tail
  doesn&#8217;t swish when the vertebrae snap.</p>
  <p>Well, you&#8217;re probably all thinking that I lead a pretty enviable existence.
  Sex drugs etc. The sex drugs are expensive though, and even they lose their
  effectiveness after a while.</p>
  <p>it&#8217;s because of this that i'm so worried about the decreasing levels of
  fertility as a result of increasing levels of oestrogen in the drinking water
  - that's why i regularly masturbate in the sink</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>but that&#8217;s had its down sides too. I wistfully remember
  how when I was younger, I thought that getting a carpal tunnel was something
  very dirty. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>back then, I used to
  masturbate furiously all the time &#8211; mind you, now I find it puts me in a
  pretty good mood</p>
  <p>Unfortunately though, I got piles. I&#8217;m not ashamed to say it. The doctor
  says that I might have picked it up sitting too long in a fixed position &#8211; on
  the toilet, as it happens. Unfortunately though, I had no choice &#8211; that&#8217;s
  where the peephole to the women&#8217;s changing rooms had to be.</p>
  <p>Piles is not a very attractive condition. Texturewise, it&#8217;s a little bit
  like when your shoelaces are undone, and they drag on the ground, so that if
  it&#8217;s been raining and you step in a puddle, then when you bend over to tuck
  them back in, they&#8217;re all stringy and damp and dripping.</p>
  <p>I often trace my lack of self-confidence back to my childhood days. I had
  asthma, ezcema and hayfever. apparently it&#8217;s medical fact that they tend to
  all go together. it was after I found that out that I founded my religion
  based on the realisation that god is actually a sadistic small child.</p>
  <p>when I was at school, they used to spike my hayfever spray with dandelion
  cordial, and put helium in my asthma nebuliser. I tried everything to cure
  myself&#8211; even acupuncture. the thing about acupuncture though is that it's a
  bit of a wild stab in the dark</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>anyway, things got better at college. I lived in a house with 8 people and
  1 fridge, lots of milk, and a lot of milk-stealing. I hate milk theft. I had
  to use more and more elaborate ploys to catch them after they got wise to the
  beartrap.</p>
  <p>First, I tried to convince them that my milk was really mouldy and off. I
  find that adding little pink bits of chopped-up marshmallow dipped in parsley
  are ideal for this - it looks just like rotting pussy ... no, *pus-ridden*
  bits of flesh</p>
  <p>So eventually I got a mate who works in a hospital to get hold of some of
  those little urine sample beakers - unused. I dyed the milk a sort of deep
  uriny orange with some crimson added for a sort of menstrual suset effect,
  and decanted it into the piss-beakers. That really did the trick.</p>
  <p>No one touched my milk after that. But - I developed a taste for piss. If
  you drink piss before going to sleep, it sends you right off to dreamland,
  and best of all, you don't have to warm it up like milk. When my housemates
  got wind of my &#8216;acquired taste&#8217;, they starting safeguarding their glasses of
  beer by disguising them &#8211; they&#8217;d dye them white and hide them in milk bottles
  and I wouldn&#8217;t touch &#8216;em.</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>I had an idea for a new revolution in user interfaces - replace the
  standard 102 key keyboard with a blow-up doll &#8211; I call it the point and clit
  interface</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>the terrible fallacy of &#8216;anything that does not kill me makes me stronger&#8217;
  &#8211; cognitive gullibility test that natural selection has devised so it doesn&#8217;t
  have to bother with predators any more to weed out the maladaptive losers</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Where possible, I like to offend. and the only thing I enjoy doing more
  than offending an entire group of people at once, is offending two entire
  opposing factions. So imagine this scene at the office party last year - the
  theme is 'Heroes and Villians'. Well, I misunderstood, and thought you had to
  go as a hero AND a villian at the same time. So I went as Osama Bin Laden cum
  Jesus Christ. the more i thought about it, there seemed to be quite a
  striking similarity. they both spend a lot of time in deserts, have big
  beards, and wear white. Admittedly Jesus hasn't been fingered for any suicide
  bombings, and Bin Laden doesn't preach a message of universal tolerance, but
  he is going to get crucified when the Americans catch him.</p>
  <p>in fact, i'd like to dedicate this to a friend of mine, a 9/11 victim -
  who i imagine died the same way he lived his life - hoping that there would
  be a special someone who would rescue him from the pain, and that no one would
  notice his blatant attempts to be the first out of the office</p>
  <p>on the iraq war - if they had spent $80b on hydrogen fuel research, they
  could have crack the problem wide open. having said that, they'll probably
  get their money back from merchandising anyway&nbsp;</p>
  <p>it's funny actually - everyone thinks bin laden is holed up in a cave in
  afghanistan. I can reveal an exclusive &#8211; the reason we haven&#8217;t been able to
  find him is because he&#8217;s in london. he&#8217;s a smart bugger, and he realised that
  the way he could cause most havoc would be as head of the london underground
  train drivers&#8217; union. he can fuck up a million people&#8217;s day and cost a
  Western country billions of pounds in one fell swoop. he&#8217;s been at this game
  for 20 years now, and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to come up with reasons
  for striking. &#8220;the sandwiches were cold last week&#8221; &#8211; we can&#8217;t work in these
  inhumane conditions. we need showers and lockers. we want more rights for
  claustrophobic tube drivers. etc. then, a couple of months ago, someone comes
  up to him with an idea. &#8220;yeah, whatever, fly it into the building if you
  think that'll work &#8211; this, here with the tube drivers, is where the real
  action's at&#8221;. so that&#8217;s how it started.</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>I believe you should live each day as if it is your last. Which is why I
  don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to wash clothes on
  the last day of their life?</p>
  <p>i'm so miserable sometimes, i just want to slit someone's wrists</p>
  <p>having said that, today was a pretty good day. i figured out how to get
  the bog roll in my bathroom to roll out smoothly today - my therapist says
  that i should look for triumphs wherever i can find them</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>i'll tell you something that irritates me. people screaming in concerts.
  you don't find that in the albert hall, do you? it's a particularly teenage
  phenomenon, as far as i can tell, and the ones just below bat auditory range
  are usually female. it's not a recent thing either. john lennon complained
  that the screaming was so loud when they played that fuckoff stadium in new
  york that no one could hear their music. if i was a front man for a band, and
  i was strumming my favourite track, about love or suicide or the trials of
  being rich and adored, and the pain of overly-frequent ejaculation, and all
  these girls were screaming at me, i'd just stop playing. till they stopped.
  maybe even hold up my hand, and make the audience sit quiet before i started
  again. because i'd feel like just some sexually-charged, sexual being, some
  sex object that people would just want to have sex with. but i'm a musician
  goddamnnit. all that sex. i mean, it's not the volume as much as the
  incoherent, wordlessness of it. i'd feel like a freak. walk on stage.
  everyone screams. i'd be, like, what's wrong. [touches face to check it's all
  there]. </p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>I&#8217;m such a carnivore, i'll eat anything that bleeds. actually that's not
  true. i draw the line at menstruating women.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Heckling<a name=Heckling></a></h3>
  <p>if any of you have seen my show before, you're probably best off going and
  getting wankered at the bar, cos it's all the same. or, go and talk to the
  big men dressed in black at the door and tell them you'd like your money
  back. bouncers, if that happens, beat the shit out of them, so that i don't
  get bored while i'm onstage</p>
  <p>the average punter asks himself, have I wasted my money on this bloke? do
  I feel embarrassed for him? if not, I&#8217;m going to fucking laugh, because I&#8217;ve
  paid fucking ten pounds. and so it doesn't matter a jot that i&#8217;m fucking crap
  at telling jokes. because you&#8217;re all laughing. you stupid fuckers. this is
  great. you nasty smelly desperate species. when the mothership lands, I
  swear, you&#8217;re all fucked. anyway. let me tell you about&#8230;</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Would you do that in the theatre? you wouldn't, would you? would you?
  *would* you??? perhaps you would. you clearly have no manners whatsoever. i
  mean, why do you do it. it's not big, and it's not clever. i wouldn't mind if
  it was clever.</p>
  <p>are you fat, or stupid, or in some other way discompensed and
  disadvantaged relative to the rest of the animal kingdom so that you feel
  bitter and justified in your uncomedic rancour?</p>
  <p>i mean, do you really think that just because you are pitiful you have
  some god-given right to be irritating as well? please, be quiet. don't add
  public self-embarrassment to your list of achievements before dying in a
  messy and probably pathetic fashion.</p>
  <p>I wonder, did your mother cry very hard when you were born? Do you think
  it&#8217;s normal that she&#8217;s still suffering from post-natal depression?</p>
  <p>Listen, you were born a turd - there's no need for you to work at it</p>
  <p>You like to stir, don&#8217;t you, sir &#8211; it&#8217;s just a shame that you&#8217;ve only got
  a little spoon</p>
  <p>I'm terribly sorry sir, but you appear to have got your aesophagus and
  your anus confused - try speaking out of the other one</p>
  <p>Mate, my job is to make you look like a dick, but you're doing just fine
  on your own, so if you just want to carry on, i'll go and get a drink</p>
  <p>Were you abused as a child? Perhaps you should have been</p>
  <p>Roll up, roll up &#8211; everybody, buy your tickets now to see the amazing
  maladaptive man &#8211; an evolutionary dead-end folks, only able to survive in
  today&#8217;s overly permissive society</p>
