  <p><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion" -->I did my first stand-up
  gig last week. It was very bracing.</p>
  <p>I want to do it again. But this time, I want people to laugh. So I&#8217;m just
  going to put material that I haven&#8217;t yet used and needs roadtesting here.
  Most of it&#8217;s crap, but if any of it evokes even a wry wrinkle of a grin, I&#8217;d
  really appreciate it if you let me know. Cheers.</p>
  <p>---</p>
  <p>I had an idea for a new revolution in user interfaces - replace the
  standard 102 key keyboard with a blow-up doll &#8211; I call it the point and clit
  interface. But it turned out that men couldn&#8217;t use it at all. So that blew up
  in my face</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m an entrepreneurial sort. so, as a means of helping my fellow
  undergrads, I set up a dating agency. with just me on the books, as it
  happens. the administration, curse them, shut me down before I could turn it
  into a sperm bank and father an entire generation.</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m such a carnivore, i'll eat anything with legs and blood. actually
  that's not true. i draw the line at menstruating women.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>you&#8217;re all giving me dirty looks. like that woman in the CVS. there I was,
  minding my own business, buying cigarettes, chocolates and condoms, and she
  glared at me like she thought I was trying to seduce a twelve-year old boy.</p>
  <p>if any of you have seen my show before, you're probably best off going and
  getting wankered at the bar, cos it's all the same. or, go and talk to the big
  men dressed in black at the door and tell them you'd like your money back.
  bouncers, if that happens, beat the shit out of them, so that i don't get
  bored while i'm onstage</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Where possible, I like to offend. and the only thing I enjoy doing more
  than offending an entire group of people at once, is offending two entire
  opposing factions. So imagine this scene at the office party last year - the
  theme is 'Heroes and Villians'. Well, I misunderstood, and thought you had to
  go as a hero AND a villian at the same time. So I went as Osama Bin Laden cum
  Jesus Christ. the more i thought about it, it seemed quite appropriate given
  the striking similarities. they both spent a lot of time in deserts, big
  beards, like to wear white. Admittedly Jesus hasn't been fingered for any
  suicide bombings, and Bin Laden doesn't preach a message of universal
  tolerance, but he is going to get crucified when the marines catch him.</p>
  <p>in fact, i'd like to dedicate this to a friend of mine, a 9/11 victim -
  who i imagine died the same way he lived his life - hoping that there would
  be a special someone who would rescue him from the pain, and that no one
  would notice his blatant attempts to be the first out of the office</p>
  <p>on the iraq war - if they had spent $80b on hydrogen fuel research, they
  could have crack the problem wide open. having said that, they'll probably
  get their money back from merchandising anyway&nbsp;</p>
  <p>it's funny actually - everyone thinks bin laden is holed up in a cave in
  afghanistan. I can reveal an exclusive &#8211; the reason we haven&#8217;t been able to
  find him is because he&#8217;s in london. he&#8217;s a smart bugger, and he realised that
  the way he could cause most havoc would be as head of the london underground
  train drivers&#8217; union. he can fuck up a million people&#8217;s day and cost a
  Western country billions of pounds in one fell swoop. he&#8217;s been at this game
  for 20 years now, and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to come up with reasons
  for striking. &#8220;the sandwiches were cold last week&#8221; &#8211; we can&#8217;t work in these
  inhumane conditions. we need showers and lockers. we want more rights for
  claustrophobic tube drivers. etc. then, a couple of months ago, someone comes
  up to him with an idea. &#8220;yeah, whatever, fly it into the building if you
  think that'll work &#8211; this, here with the tube drivers, is where the real
  action's at&#8221;. so that&#8217;s how it started.</p>
  <p><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Most comedians go in for self-deprecation. Fuck that, let me tell you
  about being hung like a horse &#8211; oh yes. I&#8217;ve been responsible for my fair
  share of snapped vertabrae, but there&#8217;s a lot less swishing of the tail
  involved as a rule</p>
  <p>it&#8217;s going to get a lot worse, ladies and gentlemen. this is, after all,
  why my girlfriend calls me The Monty Python</p>
  <p>Well, you&#8217;re probably all thinking that I lead a pretty enviable
  existence. Sex drugs etc. The sex drugs are expensive though, and even they
  stop working after a while.</p>
  <p>it&#8217;s because of this that I worry so much about the decreasing levels of
  male fertility. I blame it on too much oestrogen in the drinking water -
  that's why i make it a policy to wank in the sink twice a day</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>back when I was twelve, I used to masturbate furiously all
  the time &#8211; mind you, now I find it puts me in a pretty good mood</p>
  <p>Unfortunately though, I got piles. I&#8217;m not ashamed to say it. The doctor
  says that I might have picked it up sitting too long in a fixed position &#8211; on
  the toilet, as it happens. Unfortunately though, I had no choice &#8211; that&#8217;s
  where the peephole to the women&#8217;s changing rooms had to be.</p>
  <p>now, piles is not a very attractive condition. Texturewise, it&#8217;s a little
  bit like when your shoelaces are undone, and they drag on the ground, so that
  if it&#8217;s been raining and you step in a puddle, then when you bend over to
  tuck them back in, they&#8217;re all stringy and damp and dripping.</p>
  <p>I often trace my lack of self-confidence back to my childhood days. I had
  asthma, ezcema and hayfever, all at the same time</p>
  <p>when I was at school, they used to put helium in my oxygen nebuliser and
  spike my hayfever spray with dandelion cordial. yeah, english kids are brutal,
  but still pretty refined. I tried everything to cure myself&#8211; even
  acupuncture. the thing about acupuncture though is that it's a bit of a wild
  stab in the dark. thank you very much.</p>
  <p><span style='color:blue'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p>anyway, things did get a little better at college. I lived in a house with
  seven other people but only one fridge. I suffered from the cramped
  conditions, and the disgusting habits of my peers, but the thing that pained
  my great soul the most was the underhanded milk-stealing. I hate milk theft.
  I had to use more and more elaborate ploys to catch them after they got wise
  to the beartrap.</p>
  <p>First, I tried to convince them that my milk was really mouldy and off. I
  found that adding little pink bits of chopped-up marshmallow dipped in
  parsley are ideal for this - it looks just like rotting pussy ... no,
  *pus-ridden* bits of flesh</p>
  <p>So eventually I got a mate who works in a hospital to get hold of some of
  those little urine sample beakers &#8211; unused, mark you. I dyed the milk a sort
  of deep uriny orange with some cassis added for a sort of menstrual sunset
  effect, and decanted it into the piss-beakers. That really did the trick.</p>
  <p>No one touched my milk after that. But - I developed a taste for piss. If
  you drink piss before going to sleep, it sends you right off to dreamland,
  and best of all, you don't have to warm it up like milk. When my crafty
  housemates got wind of my &#8216;acquired taste&#8217;, they started safeguarding their
  glasses of beer by disguising them &#8211; they&#8217;d dye them white and hide them in
  milk bottles and I wouldn&#8217;t touch &#8216;em.</p>
