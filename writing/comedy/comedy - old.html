      <p> [appear on-stage, as nervous as a rabbit in a headlights. carry a cup 
        of tea. or a bacardi breezer.]</p>
      <p>Most comedians go in for self-deprecation. I thought, fuck that, let 
        me tell you about being hung like a horse &#8211; the major difference 
        is that my tail doesn&#8217;t swish when the vertebrae snap.</p>
      <p>Yes, the trials and tribulations of being a small man with an enormous 
        cock. I could tell you some stories.</p>
      <p>People often ask me, why would a man with the stage presence of a gnat 
        and the comic timing of a kinder surprise atomic clock do stand-up?</p>
      <p>But I really don't know why they ask *me* that</p>
      <p>But I tell them that I do comedy, because it's kind of like getting a 
        blowjob from every single member of the audience at once. of course, it 
        could be that i associate comedy with fellatio because my girlfriend used 
        to laugh during sex.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Stupid stories<a name="stupidstories" id="stupidstories"></a></h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Did I ever tell you about my girlfriend? I like to think about her when 
        I&#8217;m alone. [wrap mike cable round hands like bondage]</p>
      <p>I had this girlfriend who could, well, let's just say she can suck out 
        the corks from wine bottles. That comes in pretty useful when you lose 
        the corkscrew. Actually, sometimes I hide the corkscrew so that I can 
        show her off to my friends. Anyway, that's enough of that &#8211; I don&#8217;t 
        want to be indiscrete.</p>
      <p> The first time I met Jessica, I could tell she was a bit &#8230; &#8216;special&#8217;. 
        Classy, obviously. I&#8217;ve got a bit of a technique going. Finding 
        a fuck is sort of like a modern-day mating ritual. Fewer tribal drums, 
        and humans are limited by the lack of a huge bright blue fuckoff tail 
        like a peacock. I had a mate &#8211; he had no trouble with women. He&#8217;d 
        just sit by the bar, licking his eyebrows, and they&#8217;d flock to him. 
        Anyway, I realised with Jessica that when you&#8217;re going for a girl 
        like that you have to handle the situation very delicately. Girls in England 
        require finessing. First - you take her out to a pub and get her drunk. 
        But not too drunk, just so she realizes she really does like you. Then, 
        when she is all over you, you say &quot;no, i can't &#8211; you&#8217;re 
        drunk&quot;. But at least give her a kiss &#8211; you'll be drunk too 
        so you won&#8217;t care if you look like an idiot and bite her by accident. 
        Then if she wants more, go for it, otherwise wait for the next day and 
        go in for the kill.</p>
      <p>Even despite my finely honed skills and my sensitive nature, and I expect 
        you all find this, but it really isn&#8217;t easy finding a partner to 
        suit you. Actually, I&#8217;d been single for quite a long time before 
        I met Jessica. I&#8217;ve been on quite a few blind dates, I can tell 
        you. In fact, a while ago I devised a sort of rule of thumb for whether 
        a girl&#8217;s right for me or not. I think of it as kind of a relationship 
        litmus test. I usually wait till the second date, and this time it&#8217;s 
        me that gets really really drunk. As tanked as I can. More. Any plan that 
        starts with alcohol abuse can&#8217;t be all bad, after all. Have a big 
        meal. Chinese is ideal for our purposes. Then, using any means at your 
        disposal, begin the vomiting, controlled at first, and build it up to 
        test their tolerance. The way I see it, if they really love you, or at 
        least if they&#8217;re ever going to love me, the sort of girl I want&#8217;ll 
        stand by me by the toilet. Jessica&#8217;s been the first one to pass 
        the test, actually.</p>
      <p>Well, you&#8217;re probably all thinking that I lead a pretty enviable 
        existence. Sex drugs etc. The sex drugs are expensive though, and even 
        they lose their effectiveness after a while.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately though, I got piles. I&#8217;m not ashamed to say it. The 
        doctor says that I might have picked it up sitting too long in a fixed 
        position &#8211; on the toilet, as it happens. Unfortunately though, I 
        had no choice &#8211; that&#8217;s where the peephole to the women&#8217;s 
        changing rooms had to be.</p>
      <p>Piles is not a very attractive condition. Texturewise, it&#8217;s a little 
        bit like when your shoelaces are undone, and they drag on the ground, 
        so that if it&#8217;s been raining and you step in a puddle, then when 
        you bend over to tuck them back in, they&#8217;re all stringy and damp 
        and dripping.</p>
      <p>Anyway, there&#8217;s this brilliant stuff called An-u-sol. Please pay 
        attention to the pronunciation. I had an argument with the store manager 
        at Boots about it. He told me that unless I had an &#8216;annyus&#8217;, 
        it&#8217;s Anusol. He actually visible recoiled when I told him to kiss 
        my arse.</p>
      <p>Where possible, I like to offend. and the only thing I enjoy doing more 
        than offending an entire group of people at once, is offending two entire 
        opposing factions. So imagine this scene at the office party last year 
        - the theme is 'Heroes and Villians'. Well, I misunderstood, and thought 
        you had to go as a hero AND a villian at the same time. So I went as Osama 
        Bin Laden cum Jesus Christ. the more i thought about it, there seemed 
        to be quite a striking similarity. they both spend a lot of time in deserts, 
        have big beards, and wear white. Admittedly Jesus hasn't been fingered 
        for any suicide bombings, and Bin Laden doesn't preach a message of universal 
        tolerance, but he is going to get crucified when the Americans catch him.</p>
      <p>it's funny actually - everyone thinks bin laden is holed up in a cave 
        in afghanistan. I can reveal an exclusive &#8211; the reason we haven&#8217;t 
        been able to find him is because he&#8217;s in london. he&#8217;s a smart 
        bugger, and he realised that the way he could cause most havoc would be 
        as head of the london underground train drivers&#8217; union. he can fuck 
        up a million people&#8217;s day and cost a Western country billions of 
        pounds in one fell swoop. he&#8217;s been at this game for 20 years now, 
        and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to come up with reasons for striking. 
        &#8220;the sandwiches were cold last week&#8221; &#8211; we can&#8217;t 
        work in these inhumane conditions. we need showers and lockers. we want 
        more rights for claustrophobic tube drivers. etc. then, a couple of months 
        ago, someone comes up to him with an idea. &#8220;yeah, whatever, fly 
        it into the building if you think that'll work &#8211; this, here with 
        the tube drivers, is where the real action's at&#8221;. so that&#8217;s 
        how it started.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I lived in a house with 8 people and 1 fridge, lots of milk, and a lot 
        of milk-stealing. I hate milk theft. I had to use more and more elaborate 
        ploys to catch them after they got wise to the beartrap.</p>
      <p>First, I tried to convince them that my milk was really mouldy and off. 
        I find that adding little pink bits of chopped-up marshmallow dipped in 
        parsley are ideal for this - it looks just like rotting pussy ... no, 
        *pus-ridden* bits of flesh</p>
      <p>So eventually I got a mate who works in a hospital to get hold of some 
        of those little urine sample beakers - unused. I dyed the milk a sort 
        of deep uriny orange with some crimson added for a sort of menstrual suset 
        effect, and decanted it into the piss-beakers. That really did the trick.</p>
      <p>No one touched my milk after that. But - I developed a taste for piss. 
        If you drink piss before going to sleep, it sends you right off to dreamland, 
        and best of all, you don't have to warm it up like milk. When my housemates 
        got wind of my &#8216;acquired taste&#8217;, they starting safeguarding 
        their glasses of beer by disguising them &#8211; they&#8217;d dye them 
        white and hide them in milk bottles and I wouldn&#8217;t touch &#8216;em.</p>
      <p>It got quite embarrassing. Once or twice, I got caught in the bog, quenching 
        my thirst for the &#8216;amber nectar&#8217;, so to speak. The landlord 
        at my local pub caught me - he noticed that I&#8217;d cut down to just 
        the one pint a night, and he put two and two together when he also saw 
        me going into the men&#8217;s room holding a half-full pint glass, and 
        coming out with a full one. He took me to one side, very nice about it 
        he was, and he gave me his brother&#8217;s business card &#8211; a psychologist. 
        Well, I was too embarrassed to go back to my local for a little while 
        after that. But after about 6 months, seeing the shrink twice weekly, 
        I felt able to go back again. I thanked him, because his brother had sorted 
        me out beautifully. Well, what I didn&#8217;t know was they&#8217;d put 
        CCTV in the toilets, so the first time I go in to &#8216;refill my glass&#8217;, 
        the landlord rushes in and he says, &#8216;I thought you said you were 
        cured of that!&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, I said, &#8216;it doesn&#8217;t 
        bother me at all now.&#8217;</p>
      <p>One guy at the bar wasn&#8217;t too impressed &#8211; he called me names, 
        things got violent, now my refinery only stores one gallon not two, so 
        to speak</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>do you have time for a wee drinkie? it would have to be wee though</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I was an entrepreneur for a while. I had this idea. You know that song 
        that goes 'everybody needs a bosom for a pillow'. Well, I think that's 
        true. So I used to sift through the dumpster behind the Mastectomy wards 
        [picking them up and squeezing them like fruit in a supermarket], dust 
        them off a little, sell them down the market for a tidy little premium.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I often trace my lack of self-confidence back to my childhood days. </p>
      <p>I had asthma, ezcema and hayfever. apparently it&#8217;s medical fact 
        that they tend to all go together. it was after I found that out that 
        I founded my religion based on the realisation that god is actually a 
        sadistic small child.</p>
      <p>when I was at school, they used to spike my hayfever spray with dandelion 
        cordial, and put helium in my asthma nebuliser</p>
      <p>the best thing about having excema is that people just assume it's dermatological 
        cream if you cum all over yourself</p>
      <p></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>if any of you have seen my show before, you're probably best off going 
        and getting wankered at the bar, cos it's all the same. or, go and talk 
        to the big men dressed in black at the door and tell them you'd like your 
        money back. bouncers, if that happens, beat the shit out of them, so that 
        i don't get bored while i'm onstage</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>the average punter asks himself, have I wasted my money on this bloke? 
        do I feel embarrassed for him? if not, I&#8217;m going to fucking laugh, 
        because I&#8217;ve paid fucking ten pounds. and so it doesn't matter a 
        jot that i&#8217;m fucking crap at telling jokes. because you&#8217;re 
        all laughing. you stupid fuckers. this is great. you nasty smelly desperate 
        species. when the mothership lands, I swear, you&#8217;re all fucked. 
        anyway. let me tell you about&#8230;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>i'll tell you something that irritates me. people screaming in concerts. 
        you don't find that in the albert hall, do you? it's a particularly teenage 
        phenomenon, as far as i can tell, and the ones just below bat auditory 
        range are usually female. it's not a recent thing either. john lennon 
        complained that the screaming was so loud when they played that fuckoff 
        stadium in new york that no one could hear their music. if i was a front 
        man for a band, and i was strumming my favourite track, about love or 
        suicide or the trials of being rich and adored, and the pain of overly-frequent 
        ejaculation, and all these girls were screaming at me, i'd just stop playing. 
        till they stopped. maybe even hold up my hand, and make the audience sit 
        quiet before i started again. because i'd feel like just some sexually-charged, 
        sexual being, some sex object that people would just want to have sex 
        with. but i'm a musician goddamnnit. all that sex. i mean, it's not the 
        volume as much as the incoherent, wordlessness of it. i'd feel like a 
        freak. walk on stage. everyone screams. i'd be, like, what's wrong. [touches 
        face to check it's all there]. </p>

      <p>Roll up, roll up &#8211; everybody, buy your tickets now to see the amazing 
        maladaptive man &#8211; an evolutionary dead-end folks, only able to survive 
        in today&#8217;s overly permissive society</p>
      <p>I wonder, did your mother cry very hard when you were born? Do you think 
        it&#8217;s normal that she&#8217;s still suffering from post-natal depression?</p>
      <p>To have been beaten black and blue with both the stupidity *and* the 
        ugly stick - sheesh, that's harsh - I'll forgive your comment because 
        I pity you</p>
      <p>Listen, you were born a turd - there's no need for you to work at it</p>
      <p>Ah yes, i'd forgotten about the restricted vocabulary of your impoverished 
        dialect</p>
      <p>You like to stir, don&#8217;t you, sir &#8211; it&#8217;s just a shame 
        that you&#8217;ve only got a little spoon</p>
      <p>I'm terribly sorry sir, but you appear to have got your aesophagus and 
        your anus confused - try speaking out of the other one</p>
      <p>Shutup you shit-eating, algae-swilling, trogolodytic fuckwit</p>
      <p>Mate, my job is to make you look like a dick, but you're doing just fine 
        on your own, so if you just want to carry on, i'll go and get a drink</p>
      <p>Were you abused as a child? Perhaps you should have been</p>
      <p>Are there any other incoherent peasant eejits in the audience who have 
        a view? if so, kindly leave, because i don't give a bestial fuck for your 
        opinions. thank you</p>
      <p>Would you do that in the theatre? you wouldn't, would you? would you? 
        *would* you??? perhaps you would. you clearly have no manners whatsoever. 
        i mean, why do you do it. it's not big, and it's not clever. i wouldn't 
        mind if it was clever.</p>
      <p>are you fat, or stupid, or in some other way discompensed and disadvantaged 
        relative to the rest of the animal kingdom so that you feel bitter and 
        justified in your uncomedic rancour?</p>
      <p>i mean, do you really think that just because you are pitiful you have 
        some god-given right to be irritating as well? please, be quiet. don't 
        add public self-embarrassment to your list of achievements before dying 
        in a messy and probably pathetic fashion.</p>
      <p>Quiet over there or you'll feel my colossal wrath &#8211; whoah, don&#8217;t 
        get angry, wrath&#8217;s just my petname for you-know-what</p>

      <p>bugger you! - listen mate, you could be buggering me with a raging erection 
        and i'd still have room to shit</p>
      <p>Can you smell shit? are you a cattle farmer? check your shoes. oh no, 
        it's cos you're such a brown-nose</p>
      <p>Nice of you to grace us with your smell</p>

      <h3>One-liners<a name="oneliners"></a></h3>
      <p>I wrote an article. It got published in a peer-reviewed philosophy journal. 
        Pears don&#8217;t know shit about philosophy.</p>
      <p>I was arguing for a new criterion of aesthetics &#8211; I said that what 
        we look for aesthetically is for something to be a little bit familiar, 
        but different enough to be interesting &#8211; sort of like your girlfriend&#8217;s 
        sister.</p>
      <p>that'd be as painful as riding no-handed down a cobbled street</p>
      <p>when i think about my attempts to woo women, i'm reminded of von hindenberg's 
        comment about the british soldiers during the war - lions led by donkeys 
        - courage in the face of insurmountable odds, but ultimately no viable 
        strategy, and complete failure as a result</p>
      <p>i'm so miserable sometimes, i just want to slit someone's wrists</p>

        with a blow-up doll &#8211; I call it the point and clit interface</p>
      <p>i'd like to dedicate this to a friend of mine, a 9/11 victim - who i 
        imagine died the same way he lived his life - hoping that there would 
        be a special someone who would rescue him from the pain, and that no one 
        would notice his blatant attempts to be the first out of the office</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>i know that i've probably alienated a vast number of the americans in 
        the audience - but they were pretty alien to begin with. and i thought 
        it was fairer to them to make an honest joke about it, than to talk about 
        them ironically, and so exclude them without their knowing it.</p>
      <p>bell-ringing - you'd think they'd make them practice on the smaller bells

      <p>at the last school disco, I finally plucked up the courage to ask someone 
        to dance &#8211; I thought it was going quite well. till she told me at 
        the end of the evening that if dancing is poetry in motion, then I dance 
        in blank verse</p>
      <p>I went on a memory course cos I was finding it impossible to keep up 
        with the crucial little personal details of all the women I was stalking 
        at once</p>
      <p>what words ought to mean - how about 'palimpsest' - i always feel that 
        palimpsest should mean 'infected hemorrhage'</p>
      <p>the thing about acupuncture though is that it's a bit of a wild stab 
        in the dark</p>
      <p>carnivorism &#8211; i'll eat anything that bleeds. actually that's not 
        true. i draw the line at menstruating women.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><br>
        I believe you should live each day as if it is your last. Which is why 
        I don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to wash clothes 
        on the last day of their life?</p>
      <p>on the iraq war - if they had spent $80b on hydrogen fuel research, they 
        could have crack the problem wide open. having said that, they'll probably 
        get their money back from merchandising anyway<br>
        <br>
        i never masturbate furiously - it usually puts me in a pretty good mood</p>
      <p>i figured out how to get the bog roll in my bathroom to roll out smoothly 
        today - my therapist says that i should look for triumphs wherever i can 
        find them</p>
      <p>i'm worried about the decreasing levels of fertility as a result of increasing 
        levels of oestrogen in the drinking water - that's why i regularly masturbate 
        in the sink</p></td>
