<h2><a name="_Toc7457569">Philosophy</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>�To Hegel, there is no world as it appears-to-us and world
as it is in-itself, but rather a whole of which both subjects and objects are
manifestations.� (Greg) Isn�t this really rather like the agent as a bubble in
the Godviron???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>amongst the fundamental problems of utilitarianism is that
happiness does not equate with (the pursuit of happiness by) max/min
pleasure/pain</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it does seem that you have to get away from the notion of everyone
striving for happiness as the ultimate goal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doesn't the fact that we can see modern difficulties and
solutions in aristotle's writings imply that there has been no progress since
then, since he hadn't intended them yet the subtleties can be read into his
work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can i form a morality from the ground up, i.e. from personal
identity?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>can we historicise philosophy???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:38 Saturday, 03 June, 2000</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>requires metaphys assumptoins</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>habit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Hume: why is the world
algorithmically compressible?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can i come up with a set of ethical dilemmas that any
complete consistent ethical system should be able to solve?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reason alone cannot supply motive - we only deliberate about
means</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>philosophy is the cognitive equivalent of frying your brain
in its own juices. so why do it? because nothing satisfies the epistemic hunger
better than a good fried brain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>write to nick about the baldwin effect of speech
production/perception - the phonemic inventory of the world's languages is
based on the sounds we can produce and perceive, and vice versa???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in my letter to tom p, i didn't mention that empirical
investigation can't really help in certain ways though it can in others, and i
didn't mention the despondence that came over me when someone laughed at me
when i told them i was searching for ideas with my philosophy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>everything which does not kill me makes me stronger ... -
what does nietzsche mean by this? should it be taken seriously</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are there any modern-day empiricists? if so, then surely
they must realise that unless we are to be characterised as either non-mental
beings or finite state machines, our brain must do some *processing* on the
experiential information it receives. indeed, this processing needs to be far
more complicated and far deeper than merely filtering and computing sense-data.
kant's categories, of space, time, number etc., whether they are properties of
a metaphysical reality or constructed as we experience by our minds, require
the data being received to be digested ... moreover, in order for our minds to
be able to compare ideas (as Locke requires it to), associate and combine ideas
(as Hume considers), use language (a discrete combinatorial system capable of
producing an infinite number of sentences), understand mathematics and logic,
reason step-by-step, be creative - all these things show the analogy of the
blank piece of paper to be quite (deliberately) misleading</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if philosophy is too hard for me to feel that I'm ever going
to satisfy myself using its methods, am I not better diverting my energies
elsewhere and accruing wisdom by living???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in some ways, I'm less concerned about how I ought to live,
as how I ought to feel to feel content in a mad world. having said that, it
would be nice to know how other people ought to live so that I can tell them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>might it not be that your ethics will change as you develop,
so the answer to &#8216;how should one live&#8217; will be different for a pleb as opposed
to a saint??? e.g. zen monks whose very values, priorities and thought
processes have changed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the way to slow down experience is to have salient
experiences as bookmarks and embodiments of an era for you - you don't remember
a stream, even though that's how you experience, but rather you remember
episodes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>false consciousness &#8211; if a slave doesn&#8217;t want to be freed,
why should I care or try and convince him or free him, as long as he has access
to TV, the chance to educate himself and leave at any time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what&#8217;s the difference between the beautiful and the
sublime???</p>

font-family:Symbol'>\</span> I am&#8217;???</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there an argument against certainty of our perceptions???</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc7457571">Ethics</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>is there any similarity between Hume&#8217;s argument against
necessary connection in causation and Mackie&#8217;s argument from queerness against
objectivity in values &#8211; they both show that we are ill-equipped to see or
comprehend objectivity as woven into the fabric of the world, even if it were
to exist. can I use this as an argument against reason, or that reason is
inadequate to this, its most important task???</p>

<h5>Categorical imperative</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>what&#8217;s the difference between Jesus&#8217; Golden Rule and Kant&#8217;s

<p class=MsoNormal>i like to burn incense in my room. it means i can fart as
much as i like. of course all the scouts assume that i must be smoking pot 3
times a day and i'm trying to drown out the smell. that's not helped by the
fact that you can actually buy incense that smells like marijuana. this seems
quite curious to me. i can only assume that you'd buy this if you really do
like the smell, even devoid of effect, or, if you're trying to be really
clever. if the dean charges in and says, aha, i can smell marijuana, then you
can just point to the incense smugly and tell him he must be mistaken - there's
nothing illegal going on here offisher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it would be quite nice to live in a city where you don't get
that little frisson of anticipation every time you leave a building to see if
your bike's still there. at the back of my mind, i'm continually anxious to see
if it'll still be there when i next look - i feel reasonably safe while i'm
actually riding it, though i do tend to clench hold of the handlebars pretty
tight when i stop at traffic lights, just to be sure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>i've always wondered - and perhaps someone in the audience
can put me straight here - we've all been to the toilet, and had a really
satisfying dump - men often talk about it, and verbally relish the anticipatory
feeling, licking their lips (figuratively) at the prospect of getting a 'weight
of their mind' etc., even proudly contrasting their efforts with various
missiles. &quot;i wouldn't go in there for 10 mins if i were you&quot; they
say. i've often wondered about anal sex. i've never been curious enough to be
on the 'wrong end' of it. in my head it's painful and disgusting to ram
something up my anus. having said that, ramming something up someone else's
anus is highly erotic. a mystery. well, i started thinking that maybe having
anal sex with a man is sort of like a really really satisfying, repetitive shit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when i think about my attempts to woo women, i'm reminded of

<p class=MsoNormal>i'll tell you something that irritates me. people screaming
in concerts. you don't find that in the albert hall, do you? it's a
particularly teenage phenomenon, as far as i can tell, and the ones just below
bat auditory range are usually female. it's not a recent thing either. john
lennon complained that the screaming was so loud when they played that fuckoff
stadium in new york that no one could hear their music. if i was a front man
for a band, and i was strumming my favourite track, about love or suicide or
the trials of being rich and adored, and the pain of overly-frequent
ejaculation, and all these girls were screaming at me, i'd just stop playing.
till they stopped. maybe even hold up my hand, and make the audience sit quiet
before i started again. because i'd feel like just some sexually-charged,
sexual being, some sex object that people would just want to have sex with. but
i'm a musician goddamnnit. all that sex. i mean, it's not the volume as much as
the incoherent, wordlessness of it. i'd feel like a freak. walk on stage.
everyone screams. i'd be, what's wrong. [touches face to check it's all there].

<h5>cork-sucking</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>did I ever tell you about my girlfriend? I like to think
about her when I&#8217;m alone. [wrap mike cable round hands like bondage]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result, I've got a girlfriend who can, well, let's just
say she can suck out the corks from wine bottles. That comes in pretty useful when
you lose the corkscrew. Actually, sometimes I hide the corkscrew so that I can
show her off to my friends. I taught, well, trained her to do it, you know &#8211;
lot of *cross*-training in fact :~. We started off by picking up raisons with a
straw. Then we moved on to cherries. She can manage whole plums now. Then what
I used to do was hoover up an entire ball of string, and I&#8217;d make her suck the
string up back out of the hoover. Good for improving cheek capacity too. Very
important. For added incentive, I&#8217;d run the hoover up and down in a cowpat for
ten minutes beforehand, just so&#8217;s she wouldn&#8217;t be tempted to dawdle on her
alloted task. Obviously, I&#8217;d turn the hoover on half-way through. Our hoover
has a button to spew out the contents of the bag, to make it easier to empty.
Everything inside goes everywhere. That&#8217;s really funny actually &#8211; every time I
do that suddenly, she gets the same surprised look she gets just after I start
to &#8230; anyway &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to be indiscrete.</p>

<h5>mating technique</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time I met Jessica, I could tell she was a bit &#8230;
&#8216;special&#8217;. Classy, obviously. I&#8217;ve got a bit of a technique going. Finding a
fuck is sort of like a modern-day mating ritual. Fewer tribal drums, and humans
are limited by the lack of a huge bright blue fuckoff tail like a peacock. I
had a mate &#8211; he had no trouble with women. He&#8217;d just sit by the bar, licking
his eyebrows, and they&#8217;d flock to him. Anyway, I realised with Jessica that
when you&#8217;re going for a girl like that you have to handle the situation very
delicately. Girls in England require finessing. First - you take her out to a
pub and get her drunk. But not too drunk, just so she realizes she really does
like you. Then, when she is all over you, you say &quot;no, i can't &#8211; you&#8217;re
drunk&quot;. But at least give her a kiss &#8211; you'll be drunk too so you won&#8217;t
care if you look like an idiot and bite her by accident. Then if she wants
more, go for it, otherwise wait for the next day and go in for the kill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even despite my finely honed skills and my sensitive nature,
and I expect you all find this, but it really isn&#8217;t easy finding a partner to
suit you. Actually, I&#8217;d been single for quite a long time before I met Jessica.
I&#8217;ve been on quite a few blind dates, I can tell you. In fact, a while ago I
devised a sort of rule of thumb for whether a girl&#8217;s right for me or not. I
think of it as kind of a relationship litmus test. I usually wait till the
second date, and this time it&#8217;s me that gets really really drunk. As tanked as
I can. More. Any plan that starts with alcohol abuse can&#8217;t be all bad, after
all. Have a big meal. Chinese is ideal for our purposes. Then, using any means
at your disposal, begin the vomiting, controlled at first, and build it up to
test their tolerance. The way I see it, if they really love you, or at least if
they&#8217;re ever going to love me, the sort of girl I want&#8217;ll stand by me by the
toilet. Jessica&#8217;s been the first one to pass the test, actually.</p>

<h5>piles</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, you&#8217;re probably all thinking that I lead a pretty
enviable existence. Sex drugs etc. The sex drugs are expensive though, and even
they lose their effectiveness after a while.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately though, I got piles. I&#8217;m not ashamed to say
it. The doctor says that I might have picked it up sitting too long in a fixed
position &#8211; on the toilet, as it happens. Unfortunately though, I had no choice
&#8211; that&#8217;s where the peephole to the women&#8217;s changing rooms had to be. Piles is
not a very attractive condition. Texturewise, it&#8217;s a little bit like when your
shoelaces are undone, and they drag on the ground, so that if it&#8217;s been raining
and you step in a puddle, then when you bend over to tuck them back in, they&#8217;re
all stringy and damp and dripping &#8230;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyway, there&#8217;s this brilliant stuff called Annyusol. Please
pay attention to the pronunciation. I had an argument with the store manager at
Boots about it. He told me that unless I had an &#8216;annyus&#8217;, it&#8217;s Anusol. It all
started because at my local Boots, all the check out girls are 18, and
*nubile*, and not very bright. So I go up there this one time to buy supplies.
I tried to get in the queue with the ugly old biddy serving, but they swapped
just as I got to the front. And so I look at this blonde girl desperately, hoping
she won&#8217;t pass comment. But the price is missing on the box, and so she calls
it out, &#8216;Linda, how much is the Anusol?&#8217;. So I hiss at her, &#8216;Annyusol&#8217;, but she
doesn&#8217;t get the hint. I say the same thing to you that I said to her. &#8216;Kiss my
arse&#8217;.</p>

<h5>osama-jesus</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where possible, I like to offend. and the only thing I enjoy
doing more than offending an entire group of people at once, is offending two
entire opposing factions. So you can imagine the scene at the Heroes and
Villians bop, when I misunderstood, and thought you had to go as a hero AND a
villian at the same time. So I went as Osama Bin Laden cum Jesus Christ. the
more i thought about it, there seemed to be quite a striking similarity. they
both spend a lot of time in deserts, have big beards, and wear white.
Admittedly Jesus hasn't been fingered for any suicide bombings, and Bin Laden
doesn't preach a message of universal tolerance, but he is going to get
crucified when the Americans catch him.</p>

<h5>bungee</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did you hear about the lateset bungee-jumping escapade &#8211;
last week was the occasion of the first bungee attempt off a helicopter.
Unfortunately, they misjudged how much he'd bounce back up...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I met the inventor of the bungee jump &#8211; he&#8217;s just invented a
trebuchet. It&#8217;s based on the sort of catapults they used in medieval days for
storming castles, but it&#8217;s been scaled up to propel a man 200 feet into the air
at 55 miles an hour, so he told me proudly. It&#8217;s all very carefully calculated
according to body weight. I looked up the story on the Internet. It&#8217;s true
enough. He designed it in secret as his (like-minded) wife&#8217;s birthday present.
And sure enough, she was the first to try it. Hwuuuhng, perfect trajectory,
landed beautifully in the centre of the enormous net they&#8217;d erected, and
bounced beautifully back out again to land and shatter her hips. The first
trial was a *mitigated* success, he&#8217;s quoted as saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My other favourite bungee story is about bungee running. You
get two people in a funfair, and they both peg it like apeshit to get as far as
they can before before the elastic rope tied round their waists flings them
back. There&#8217;s a story about this guy who clearly had some sort of vendetta
against his trusty postie. He wired his vicious dog up to a bungee rope, so
that when the postman comes to deliver the letters and sees the dog careering
towards him, he fled helter-skelter straight into traffic. He made it to the
other side of the road just in time to see the dog catapulted straight back
through the living room bay window.</p>

<h5>milk-stealing</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>I lived in a house with 8 people and 1 fridge, lots of milk,
and a lot of milk-stealing. I <i>hate</i> milk theft. I had to use more and
more elaborate ploys to catch them after they got wise to the beartrap.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, I tried to convince them that my milk was really
mouldy and off. I find that adding little pink bits of chopped-up marshmallow
dipped in parsley are ideal for this - they like like rotting pussy ... no,
pus-ridden, i mean, bits of flesh</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Got a medic mate to procure some hospital urine sample
containers - unused. Decanted the milk into that. Worked pretty well for a
while, just cos people are finicky like that. Just to be sure, I stuck a label
on it: &#8216;Sample F96Z, super-smallpox strain, control experiment, Ealing Centre
for Islamic Studies, 10th September 2001. Likewise with powdered milk &#8211; just
pop it into an envelope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then, I ended up dyeing the milk a sort of uriny yellow
orange colour, which really did the trick. No one touched my milk after that.
But I developed a taste for piss. If you drink piss before going to sleep, it
sends you right off to dreamland, and best of all, you don't have to warm it up
like milk. When my housemates got wind of my &#8216;acquired taste&#8217;, they starting
safeguarding their glasses of beer by disguising them &#8211; they&#8217;d dye them white
and hide them in milk bottles and I wouldn&#8217;t touch &#8216;em.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It got quite embarrassing. Once or twice, I got caught in
the bog, quenching my thirst for the &#8216;amber nectar&#8217;, so to speak. The landlord
at my local pub caught me out &#8211; he noticed that I&#8217;d cut down to just the one
pint a night, and he put two and two together when he also saw me going into
the men&#8217;s room holding a half-full pint glass, and coming out with a brand new
pint. He took me to one side, very nice about it he was, and he gave me his
brother&#8217;s business card &#8211; a psychologist. Well, I was too embarrassed to go
back to my local for a little while after that. But after about 6 months,
seeing the shrink twice weekly, I felt able to go back again. I thanked him,
because his brother had sorted me out beautifully. Well, what I didn&#8217;t know was
they&#8217;d put CCTV in the toilets, so the first time I go in to &#8216;refill my glass&#8217;,
the landlord rushes in and he says, &#8216;I thought you said you were cured of
that!&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, I said, &#8216;it doesn&#8217;t bother me at all now.&#8217;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do you have time for a wee drinkie? it would have to be wee

<h5>philosophy</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wrote an article. It got published in a peer-reviewed
philosophy journal. Pears don&#8217;t know shit about philosophy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was arguing for a� new criterion of aesthetics &#8211; I said
that what we look for aesthetically is for something to be a little bit
familiar, but different enough to be interesting &#8211; sort of like your
girlfriend&#8217;s sister.</p>

<h5>afghanistan</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>everyone thinks bin laden is holed up in a cave in afghanistan.
I can reveal an exclusive &#8211; the reason we haven&#8217;t been able to find him is
because he&#8217;s in london. he&#8217;s a smart bugger, and he realised that the way he
could cause most havoc would be as head of the london underground train
drivers&#8217; union. he can fuck up a million people&#8217;s day and cost a Western
country billions of pounds in one fell swoop. he&#8217;s been at this game for 20
years now, and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to come up with reasons for
striking. &#8220;the sandwiches were cold last week&#8221; &#8211; we can&#8217;t work in these
inhumane conditions. we need showers and lockers. we want more rights for
claustrophobic tube drivers. etc. then, a couple of months ago, someone comes
up to him with an idea. &#8220;yeah, whatever, fly it into the building if you think
that'll work &#8211; this, here with the tube drivers, is where the real action's
at&#8221;. so that&#8217;s how it started.</p>

<h5>getting beaten up</h5>

<p class=MsoNormal>I&#8217;m not a very tall person. You may already have noticed.
Unfortunately though, two things happen as a rule when I get drunk. I vomit.
And I get quite aggressive. My two best friends are 6 foot twins, so I&#8217;m
usually alright. But there was this one time, coming home to Harrow, and I&#8217;d
had to run for the train. I caught it, and before long I was on my own in the
carriage, possibly because I was noisily but contentedly vomiting into a
plastic bag I&#8217;d found. Quite a civilised solution, I thought. Anyway, it all
happened when I was waiting for a taxi in a long queue at 1, outside the
station, and I&#8217;d finally got to the front when this bald fat bloke tries to
jump into *my* taxi! I tried to tell him, and was even quite assertive. Fucker
didn&#8217;t even register. You&#8217;d have all done the same thing next, I&#8217;m sure. I
tapped him on the shoulder &lt;blow into bag and splat it&gt;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I&#8217;ve got to admit, I wasn&#8217;t entirely prepared for the
results. A pretty effective solution, I can tell you. I didn&#8217;t know this, but
regurgitated curry is still quite potent, and very caustic if it gets in your
eyes, nose, mouth, all over your shirt, down your neck. He was a little
shocked, I can tell you. I went to jump in the taxi, and we disappeared down
the street. He wasn&#8217;t happy. Just as well I was able to make a quick getaway,
because I wasn&#8217;t keen on the prospect of hitting him, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Driving While Dumb - A man in Swansea, Wales, who managed to
violate the gamut of driving laws and basic common sense in one action-packed
incident, takes the prize for poor motorist skills. The one-armed driver --
drunk and clutching his mobile phone to his ear as he sped down a city street
and jumped a red light -- has been fined and banned from driving for 18 months.
Stuart MacNamara, who lost half his right arm in an accident, was found to be
well over the legal alcohol limit when stopped by police over the weekend.
&quot;I think it would be fair to say this is a pretty unusual case,&quot;
police superintendent Richard Lewis said. &quot;We urge the public not to do
any of these things in isolation -- let alone all together.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is it the ability to respond to internalised info that gives

<p class=MsoNormal>if the speed of light is absolute, isn't then distance and

<p class=MsoNormal>when he says that quantitative hedonists assign some actions
extrinsic value, he's saying that intellectual activities might have greater
extrinsic value cos they give more (though not better) pleasure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>any ethical system wh can only evaluate actions or states of
affairs exclusively (i.e. particular aspects/levels of ethics) is
insufficient/flawed - morality should be discernible in any form</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perhaps the solution to a multi-dimensional vector is being
able to create new strings/threads/variables and give them a name as part of
the constructor - this might require extending Vector to have setName and
getName methods and a new constructor which allows us to call them by their
names (as I think you can with threads). these names could be automatically
generated and then referenced as a co-ordinate system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humour as my thesis: humour is our way of celebrating the
efficacy of the mental - the fact that we find robotic actions funny (see
Laughter, Bergson) is the same reason that we find unexpected (i.e.
non-determined) punchlines funny. it's all tied in with the fact that we have
phenomenology, with downward causation, so we find cultural stereotypes funny
cos we have a them-and-us mentality, and because it's almost as if the
stereotypical figures *don't* have the conscious ability to alter their actions
on the basis of mental states. it's a social phenomenon because language
evolved to serve a social communicative function (though humour is not
necessarily linguistic - hmmm???)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SF story &#8211; the merits of telepathic (imagistic) relative to
writing + speaking. because the other person feels the sense of the idea in the
same way that the person who had the idea, it&#8217;s harder to criticise it as a 3rd
person. can one do philosophy by mind-transfer &#8211; no, because though words are
inherently interpretive, their unavoidable vagueness is at least made publicly
explicit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>maybe I'm an idealist, in some senses at least. I believe in
the agent and the environment, bubbles in the medium, and that we float about,
perhaps with agency and self-propelled, perhaps not, and that matter, energy
and mind are one, as they must be</p>
