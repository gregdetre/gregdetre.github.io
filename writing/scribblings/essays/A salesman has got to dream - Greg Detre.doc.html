<h1><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>‘A salesman [has] got to dream’.</span><span
style='font-weight:normal'> - Is this a satisfactory summing up of Willy’s
plight?<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The basic picture presented of
Willy is of a tired and broken man, losing hope, direction and his grip on
sanity, with dire consequences for himself and those who depend upon him.
Examining the nature of Willy’s plight requires looking at him in the light of
his roles as a salesman, a dreamy human worthy of sympathy, and a 1950s
American father. This will help to see what has made Willy the way he is, and
what could make him happy. It is also necessary to investigate in detail
exactly what difficulties Willy is grappling with, as well as the effects he is
having upon those around him, in order to best understand the causes and
precise nature of his plight; then, the extent to which it can be
satisfactorily summed up by the statement, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a salesman is got to dream’</span></i>
can be assessed. This is a line spoken by Charley to Willy, in his typically
simple and Americanistically ungrammatical manner of speech, which masks a
critical and detached insight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Discussion of the title requires
firstly understanding how Willy’s being a salesman and a dreamer are linked to
his plight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Everyone dreams. To a greater or
lesser extent, we are all subject to the phantasms of the mind, re-routing the
paths of the past into an imagined future. It is human to aspire to ambitions,
or dreams, contemplating impossible possibilities and even imagining ourselves
actually living these fantasies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm'>However, Willy is beyond the realms
of normal, healthy, sane dreams grounded in a proper perception of reality. He
is rare and dangerous because he is at that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘terrible moment when the voice of the
past is no longer distant but quite as loud as the voice of the present’ <a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a></span></i>.
There can be little doubt that these vivid distortions of reality are somehow
tied to Willy’s plight. The schitzophrenic’s disorder can be traced to a
physical defect which renders them unable to distinguish between voices
supplied and created by the brain, and real outside voices; Willy shares this
inability to retain the grip on reality which is one of the factors which cause
him to be labelled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘crazy’</span></i>. Willy talks to
himself, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘spewing
out that vomit from his mind’</span></i>, which Linda defends saying, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘what
goes through a man’s mind, driving seven hundred miles home without having
earned a cent? Why shouldn't he talk to himself? Why?’</span></i> Her vehemence,
demonstrated by the repeated question forms, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘why shouldn't he …, why?’</span></i>
is a testament to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘iron repression’</span></i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘she
has developed of her exceptions to Willy’s behaviour’</span></i>, for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘she
more than loves him, she admires him’</span></i> <a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
Despite his anger at being called this, he sometimes admits to his tenuous grip
on the present and real; even at the very beginning of the play, he confesses
brokenly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
just can't seem to keep my mind on it’</span></i>. These rare, miserable
moments of revealing self-doubt are touching and distressing, often included
amidst a battery of bravado, heightening the intial sense of foreboding. Linda,
who knows him best, tries to down-play the gravity of his instability by
saying, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a
lot of people think he’s lost his – balance. But you don't have to be very
smart to know what his trouble is. The man is exhausted’</span></i>. This is
corroborated by Willy’s first few lines, in which he says brokenly, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I'm
tired to the death’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Many of the things upsetting Willy
and with which he is having trouble, such as his personal status, his job and
his sons, are a result of basic psychological problems, which Miller goes to
great lengths to explain in terms of environment and upbringing and the
American idolisation of opportunistic and rich “great men” like Ben, who have
braved the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘jungle’</span></i>
and returned laden with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘diamonds’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>However, it is not just dreaming in
terms of daydreams and “flashbacks” which are inherent in Willy’s plight.
“Dreaming” also encompasses the dangerous ambition and plans and desires for
the future which so harm his relationship with Biff. Why is it that a salesman
in particular has to dream? Certainly, a salesman needs that ability to see a
wonderful future in order to instil his products with the false optimism that
will sell them, much like the manipulative advertising that is our modern
equivalent. A salesman sells potential, the utility that the buyer would gain
from the purchase of his goods. Willy realises the need for personality, for
selling is convincing the buyer of how much better life would be if they were
to buy the product, which necessarily involves buying the salesman’s pitch. In
order to paint the most desirable picture of the future, involving the
potential buyer and placing them in the magic imagined picture requires
creativity and imagination, as well as the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘personal attractiveness’</span></i> he
tries to foster in his boys, which is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘why I thank Almighty God you’re both
built like Adonises’</span></i>, because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘in the business world’</span></i> <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the
man who makes an appearance’</span></i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘creates personal interest’ ‘gets ahead’</span></i>;
his creed is summarised by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘be liked and you will never want’</span></i>.
Charley takes the opposite view, asking with his usual rough rhetoric, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘when’re
you going to realise that them things don’t mean anything?’</span></i>. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘The
only thing you got in this world is what you can sell’</span></i>. The salesman
that Willy archetypally represents recognises the need to engage with people,
needing reputation and being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘impressive’</span></i>. This in turn
builds badly-needed confidence, which in turn increases success by heightening
the enthusiasm with which clients buy his dream. Cyclically, this reputation
and success will give him more “clout”, just as Singleman could <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘pick
up a phone and be remembered and loved and helped by so many different people’</span></i>.
For Willy, when people reject his product, they are rejecting him, for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘they
don’t know me any more’</span></i> and no one is prepared to send him an order <i

a pinch’</span></i> out of friendship, as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘in those days when there was personality
in it’</span></i>. Willy fell in love with the idea of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘making his living’ ‘at the
age of eighty-four’</span></i>, for when he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘saw that’</span></i>, he misguidedly and
short-sightedly <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘realised that selling was the greatest career a man could
want’</span></i>. However, now all his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘old buyers’</span></i> are now <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘dead
or retired’</span></i>, and the modern way grants little credit for all that he
has painstakingly tried to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘build with this firm’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:9.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Willy painfully realises the need for imagination,
necessary to ground people’s dreams in the material. Perhaps at one time, his
belief and involvement in the vividness of his own dreams made him more effective
and inspiring; having spent so long dreaming on other people’s behalf, and
becoming so </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> (as Happy himself is now
experiencing), he has convinced himself of the value of material dreams. It can
be seen from the effect his career has had on him that it is dangerous for an
impressionable man like Willy to become a dedicated salesman, for his desire to
</span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>) into these dangerously
exaggerated delusions. Willy wants to buy his own pitch, but cannot afford the
samples of a better life he carries in his valises. </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Death of a Salesman</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> is doubly critical of the capitalist creed, because
though Charley seems fairly secure in his wealth, the merchandise manager does
not have the </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘peace

enjoy what he works so hard for, just as Happy knows he would not either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>In many ways, the salesman is
merely tapping into the appetitive side of the human psyche. Willy is
especially insecure and grasping as a person, and so this ambitious, dreamy
greed is translated by his own salesmanship into a desire for wealth, success
and popularity for himself. He is surrounded by these ideals, and measures
fulfilment in terms of them. The acquisitive mixture of Willy’s particular
personality combined with what is asked of him in the salesman’s role in the
American Dream, bringer of all good things, prove too heady a cocktail for
Willy’s modest talents. Faced with this irreconcilable gap between his in-bred,
up-brought aspirations and his abilities, he resorts to the ultimately damaging
policies of self-deception and vicarious vivacity, which he propagates as his
family values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>However, there are also ways in
which Willy could be said to suffering as a result of a multitude of other
factors besides his profession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>On a deeper level, Willy describes
himself as still feeling <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘kind of temporary about myself’</span></i>,
that those around him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘don't need’</span></i> him, and says <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
can't seem to keep my mind to it’</span></i> when driving (or living, for that
matter). He links his long-term malaise with the fact that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Dad left when I was such a
baby, and I never had a chance to talk to him’</span></i>. Willy identifies Ben
with his absent father, shown by how Willy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘longingly’</span></i> begs him, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘can't
you stay a few days? You’re just what I need, Ben’</span></i>, as part of his
desire for validation of his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘fine position’ </span></i>from these
authoritarian paternal arbiters of success. Willy’s father is described by Ben
as a man who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘with one gadget … made more in a week than a man like you
could make in a lifetime’</span></i>. There are many differences between Willy
and his father, as perceived through Ben. Both <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘drive … right across the
country’</span></i>, selling. However, Willy’s imagined father <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘tossed
the whole family into the wagon’</span></i>, taking them with him. The whole
image is romanticised, with the emphasis on a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘very great and very
wild-hearted man’</span></i>, who <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘played the flute’</span></i>, and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘great
inventor’</span></i>. Crucially, Willy’s father was his own boss, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘selling
the flutes that </span></i><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>he’d
made <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>on the way’</i></span>, rather than
the the mass-made, mundane stockings and the like that Willy sells (for Happy
and Willy, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘selling
is selling’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘it gets to be like everything else’</span></i>,
whereas Willy’s father is selling his creation rather than his personality).
Willy carries samples with him, because his products are all the same, just as
Willy himself is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a dime a dozen’</span></i>. Willy’s father, with his own
hand-made, individual musical instruments and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘rollicking tune’</span></i>
that surrounds him in Willy’s mind, is truly a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘leader of men’</span></i>
in one of the ways Willy would like to be. With each of these imagined
characters, Willy is following his life down a different path according to
choices he could have made, whether being a nomadic creator/salesman (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he
was so wonderful with his hands’</span></i>), cracking the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘oyster’</span></i> of the
world in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘dark’ ‘jungle’</span></i> or simply becoming a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘partner’</span></i>
with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘old
man Wagner’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy worries that although <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘some
people accomplish something’</span></i>, he is still trying to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘figure
it out’</span></i>, and seems to want for himself what he demands of Bernard
for Biff, that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘you’ll give him the answers’</span></i>, almost as though
there is some magic formula for life. He desperately wants to leave his mark,
and yet in the swirling transient tide of mercenary capitalism, this is very
difficult. Linda argues with Ben, wondering <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘why must everyone want to conquer the
world?’</span></i> and encouraging Willy by telling him that he has <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘enough
to be happy right here, right now’</span></i>. Even so, Willy defensively and
uncertainly tries to justify his life to Ben, the embodiment of all that is
restless and seeking in him (described as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘success incarnate’</span></i>, implying
almost a divine, or devilish avatar): <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I'm building something with this firm,
Ben, and if a man is building something he must be on the right track, mustn't
he?’</span></i> This is characteristic of the pleading, self-questioning way
with which Willy addresses his older brother, and others whom he respects,
either for their success or self-assurance, whenever honestly addressing what
is pressing on his mind so heavily. The dubiousness of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mustn't he’</span></i>,
and the restatement of his own assertion in the form of a question, seeking
approval, indicate how little faith Willy has in his own ideals (which we are
shown most honestly in discussions with figments of his own mind like Ben, much
like Shakespearian asides). Ben responds dismissively with, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘what
are you building, Willy’</span></i>, asking him to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘lay his hand on it’</span></i>.
Willy values money, for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘that is something one can feel with the
hand, it is there’</span></i>. Part of the difficulties between Willy and Biff
are because Biff is an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘idealist’ ‘poet’</span></i>, in stark
contrast to Willy, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a happy man with a batch of cement’</span></i>
who likes to have ‘<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>something one can feel with the hand, [that]
is there’</span></i>. Biff remembers nostalgically that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘there were a lot of nice
days’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘when he’d come home from a trip’</span></i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘making’</span></i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘finishing’</span></i>
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘stoop’</span></i>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘cellar’</span></i>,
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘porch’</span></i>
etc. He notes, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘there’s more of him in that front stoop than in all the
sales he ever made’</span></i>, which is perhaps a satisfying and comforting
epitaph, though Willy himself might not have thought it so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy builds a very dysfunctional
and troubled household. He teaches the value of success according to the
capitalist criteria, while secretly wishing to escape to the real “land of
opportunity” represented by Alaska and the ranch. Being a pressurised father in
a patriarchal society, he feels keenly the need to achieve the success he
preaches to his sons, trying to be loved, liked, admired and disciplinarian to
them. This confusion is contrasted with the constancy of Charley’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘never’</span></i>
telling Bernard <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘what to do’</span></i> or taking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘any interest in him’</span></i>.
Biff and Happy correspondingly feel the need for Willy’s approval, which is
complicated by the different treatment they receive, showing how their
different upbringings have led to their adulthood, with their own
personalities, problems attitudes and neuroses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Biff indignantly bursts out, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Those
ungrateful bastards’</span></i> to which Linda witheringly replies, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Are
they any worse than his sons?’</span></i>. It is no wonder that Linda describes
him as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘dying’</span></i>.
She defends him passionately, demanding <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘what goes through a man’s mind, driving
seven hundred miles home without having earned a cent? Why shouldn't he talk to
himself? Why?’</span></i> She is scathing towards Biff and Happy, whom she
terms a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘philandering
bum’</span></i> and refuses to let Biff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘go near’</span></i> Willy. She
eventually tells them to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Get out of here, both of you, and don't
come back’</span></i>. It is comforting for the audience to know that for the
staunchly-loving Linda, Willy is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the dearest man in the world to me, and
I won't have anyone making him feel unwanted and low and blue’</span></i>, even
her sons. Yet, upsetting, even this is not enough for him. He needs to feel
accepted by the masculine, materialistic, judging world in which he moves,
epitomised by Ben. This excess of desire and demand is definitely something to
be pitied in Willy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Unfortunately, Willy’s own
faltering in pursuit of the capitalist ideals does not come out in his dealings
with his sons; rather, he breeds in them a closed-minded utter acceptance of
the validity and completeness of the “Great American Dream”. Had he perhaps
been less dogmatic, then they might be better able to choose the dream for
themselves that they know is right. For though Willy asserts <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
never in my life told him anything but decent things’</span></i>, there are
examples of where this could be disputed, (such as contradictingly telling Biff
about the ball he has <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘borrowed’</span></i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
want you to return that’</span></i>, then laughing confidentially and
distorting and undermining the important message by saying that the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘coach’ll
probably congratulate you on your initiative’</span></i>). That Biff is <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mixed
up very bad’</span></i> is displayed by his early conversation with Happy,
carried on in parallel with Willy and Linda’s discussion of the same subject.
To a large extent, Willy has passed on his own uncertainty to both Biff and
Happy, for Willy critically dismisses the life that Biff would like to choose
with the small-minded condemnation, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he has yet to make thirty-five dollars a
week.’ ‘Is that a life?’</span></i>, and yet it seems that he too would
probably be happier amidst the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘grass and trees and the horizon’</span></i>,
rather than being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘boxed … in’</span></i> by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘solid vault of apartment
houses’</span></i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘lined with cars’</span></i> in this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘nuthouse’</span></i>
of a city. Willy’s relationship with his adored older son is fraught, and
causes both much anguish. Biff says that he knows <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he’s a fake, and [Willy]
doesn't like anybody around who knows’</span></i>. Despite the anger he feels
towards him, which has grown since the cruelly formative experience with
Willy’s mistress, Biff still cares enough to lament sorrowfully that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘everything
I say there’s a twist of mockery on his face. I can't get near him’</span></i>.
Similarly, Willy is extremely touched when he realises ‘[Biff] always did’, ‘he
loves me’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The familial situation is difficult
for all involved, because despite the deep but destructive love they bear each
other, Willy is vicariously living his life through Biff, and sees any failure,
laziness or indirection on Biff’s part as Biff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘spiting me’</span></i>.
This is shown by the way Willy responds to Ben’s belittlement of himself with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘That’s
just the way I'm bringin them up, Ben – rugged, well liked, all-around’</span></i>,
as though he can somehow make up for his own inadequacies through his boys.
This is similar to the way in which he says to Biff and Happy that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘one
day’</span></i>, he’ll be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘bigger than Uncle Charley’</span></i>,
who is merely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘liked but not well liked’</span></i>, and yet this
eventually becomes <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘when the mail comes, [Biff]’ll be ahead
of Bernard again’</span></i>, as though this too will somehow vindicate Willy’s
own failure. This puts a great strain on Biff and their relationship,
eventually inducing Biff to decide to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘wrap it up’</span></i> by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘going
and … not writing any more’</span></i>, which is not what either of them truly
want. Yet, as Linda observes resignedly, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘there’s no use drawing it out. You’ll
just never get along’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>It is tragic that it is the
intensity of Willy’s loving and parental hopes for his son that cause the rift,
and give him such problems. Biff complains that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I never got anywhere
because you blew me so full of hot air I could never stand taking orders from
anybody! That’s whose fault it is!’</span></i>. This bitterness towards
superiors and authorities is shared by Willy, who is resentful towards Charley
who offers him a job, but Willy keeps on turning it down until Charley finally
tells him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘you
been jealous of me all your life, you damned fool!’</span></i>. Willy’s
misunderstanding and misperception of other people is one of the things that
makes him so hard for anyone else to relate to and interact with. The hypocrisy
is worrying with which he labels Charley an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘ignoramus’</span></i>, telling him <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
don't play with cheats’</span></i> when we have more faith in Charley’s
card-playing, and shouting <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘don't insult me’</span></i> when it is
Willy who should be apologising. He often contradicts himself, calling Biff a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘lazy
bum’</span></i>, then moments later unwittingly contradicting himself,<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘if
there’s one thing about Biff, he’s not lazy’</span></i> (e.g. his decision to
buy the fridge and the car, and misremembering opening the windshield on the Chevy).
He makes excuses, saying <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the trouble was’</span></i> one thing or
another out of his control, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘otherwise I woulda broke records’. </span></i>For
this and his whole attitude, Biff angrily rebukes him later, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘we
never told the truth for ten minutes in this house’</span></i>, as exemplified
by Happy, almost the image of Willy, actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘one of two assistants to
the assistant’</span></i>, who is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘full of it’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy is ageing, and scared of what
the future will bring for his fortunes, saying <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I don't want a change’</span></i>.
Other shifts undermine Willy’s sense of stability. Besides the social shifts
which are rendering his approach obsolete and unsuccessful, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘in
those days’</span></i> all <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘his old friends, the old buyers that
loved him so and always found some order to hand him in a pinch – they’re all
dead, retired’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘now he takes his valises out of the car
and puts them back and takes them out again and he’s exhausted’</span></i>.
When Linda buys a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘new kind of American-type cheese’</span></i>, he
over-reacts, snapping <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I don't want a change!’ ‘Why am I always
being contradicted?</span></i>’. Willy is ageing perceptibly, times are
changing, and he is finding it difficult to adapt. This is even affecting
Linda, as Biff is distraught because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘your hair got so grey’</span></i>. She
brushes it off with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘oh, it’s been grey since you were in
high school. I just stopped dyeing it, that’s all’</span></i>. With the
characteristic Loman propensity for self-deception, he asks her to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘dye
it again, will ya? I don't want my pal </span></i><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>looking<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> old’</i></span>.
Just as Charley refers to Willy as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘boy’</span></i>, asking him when he’s
going to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘grow
up’</span></i>, so Linda rebukes Biff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘you’re such a boy’</span></i>, which he
recognises in himself. There is something of the child in the way in which
Willy play-acts his entire life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The nature of his job and the
pervading work ethic is to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘work like a coolie’</span></i> all his
life, making the most of his meagre talents. Although he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘never made a lot of money’</span></i>,
Linda asserts that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘attention must be finally paid to such a
person’</span></i>, though in this <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘rough world’</span></i>, Linda fails to
understand <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘why
didn't anybody come?’</span></i>. It is a mark of the society he lives in that
one is measured in terms of current worth, with little merit being placed on a
lifetime’s commitment of the sort Willy believes in, the traditional values. He
bitterly complains to Charley, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I'm strapped. I don't know what to do. I
was just fired’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘that snotnose. Imagine that? I named
him. I named him Howard’</span></i>. Charley is successful in much the way that
Willy would like to be, and yet displays the opposite ethos, admitting <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘my
salvation is that I never took any interest in anything’</span></i>. This is
accentuated by his adding to extra effect, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘there’s some money – fifty dollars’</span></i>,
emphasisising his indifference to the very things which seem to provide Willy
with purpose. Charley asks frankly a question which would otherwise never cross
Willy’s mind, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘why must everybody like you?’</span></i>. Although we
cannot really know from whence his need to be so popular arises, it is is
linked to the motives which induced Willy to see selling as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the
greatest career a man could have’</span></i>, mainly inspired by the desire to
emulate Dave Singleman. However, his downfall is demanding too much of himself
by feeling the need to be both well-liked and impressive. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘When’re you going to
realise that them things don't mean anything. You named him Howard, but you
can't sell that’</span></i>, though sound observations from Charley, fall on
Willy’s disastrously deaf ears. Charley summarises this ruthless and wearying
way of life by noting that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the only thing you got in this world is
what you can sell’</span></i>. Charley notes that irony that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the
funny thing is that you’re a salesman, and you don't know that’</span></i>.
Even the deluded Happy has learnt that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Dad is never so happy as when he’s
looking forward to something’</span></i>; he has lived <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘just to know there’s the
possibility for better things’</span></i>. Miller says that the play was in
part about the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘concept that nothing in life comes “next” but that
everything exists together and at the same time with within us’</span></i>, and
he tried to mirror this in a form that would <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘literally be the process
of Willy Loman’s way of mind’</span></i>. Part of the pop philosophy that has
been absorbed into the current Western intellectual <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>zeitgeist</span></i> is a
recognition of the need to “live for the moment” (just as a peculiar and
misunderstood array of Freudian notions have now become almost truisms through
over-use), and it is not surprising that Willy is so dissatisfied given his
preoccupation with the dream, rather than its realisation or present enjoyment.
Though his legacy, Happy, thinks it a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘good dream’</span></i>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the
only dream you can have’</span></i>, Biff, with whom the audience has more faith
and yet more concern for, laments that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he had the wrong dreams’, ‘all, all
wrong’</span></i>. Willy was doubly doomed: by what he dreamt of, and the way
in which his compulsive dreaming impinged upon the present (and the realisation
of those dreams).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy’s desperate desire to further
Biff uses Bernard as a yardstick. Before his suicide, he gleefully imagines <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘that
magificence with twenty thousand dollars in his pocket’</span></i>, predicting
fiercely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘when
the mail comes he’ll be ahead of Bernard again’</span></i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even at the very end, Willy fails, or
refuses, to realise the futility of this attempt to quantify and correlate
happiness with tokens of contentment. He seems to hold this idea of <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘being
ahead’</span></i> synonymous with his love for Biff, wanting to best for him
(although for whose sake is more dubitable): this glee at the thought that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
always knew one way or another we were gonna make it, Biff and I!’</span></i>
is intermingled with the more touching <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘did you see how he cried to me? Oh, if I
could kiss him, Ben!’</span></i>.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy over-values money and the
material. This is partly a consequence of the era in which he lived, which
defined and quantified success in terms of salary and status. Willy sees this
in the simple terms of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘with twenty thousand dollars’ ‘he’ll be
magnificent’</span></i>. Part of Willy’s breakdown could be traced to the
indignity of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘now in his old age they take his salary away’</span></i>,
leaving him <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘on straight commission, like a beginner, an unknown!’</span></i>,
for truly, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘no
man only needs a little salary’</span></i>. He yearns for a comfortable,
satisfied retirement with something to be proud of, causing him to be so hard
on Biff: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘not
finding yourself at thirty-four’</span></i> in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘greatest country in the
world’ ‘is a disgrace’</span></i>. Perhaps he is really voicing his frustration
that Biff <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘not
getting anywhere’</span></i> deprives Willy of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘silver … trophy’</span></i>
of achievement. It is almost as though Willy’s sorrow is more that Biff not
finding himself at Willy’s age of sixty-three is a disappointment for his
father. However, this is justified with what seems like a personal attack,
recriminating Biff with the destitute <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘disgrace’</span></i> of a money-driven
society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Like Biff, Willy secretly yearns
for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘grand
outdoors’</span></i>. Ben, his ideal, thrived in the wild <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘jungle’</span></i>,
soaring and succeeding in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘diamonds’</span></i>, rather than measly
cooped-up commerical pay-packets. Biff and Happy enthuse, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘men built like we are
should be working out in the open’</span></i>, because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘the trouble is we weren't
brought up to grub for money’</span></i>. Willy’s sentiments are expressed by
Ben and his sons: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘get out of these cities, they’re full of talk and time
payments and courts of law’</span></i>, taking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘orders from those common,
petty son-of-bitches till I can't stand it any more’</span></i>. He wants to do
as Ben bids him, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘screw on your fists and you can fight for a fortune up
there’</span></i>, in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘new continent at your doorstep’</span></i>,
just as Happy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘dreams about’ ‘outboxing goddam merchandise manager’</span></i>.
The Lomans are better suited to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘raise cattle, use our muscles’</span></i>,
just as Willy’s response to Charley’s painful insights is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘you big ignoramus. If you
say that to me again, I'll rap you one’</span></i>. Willy has made his career
out of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘damn-fool
appointments’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘talk and time payments’</span></i>, and
now that he feels the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘woods are burning’</span></i> around
him, it is almost too late to escape and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘rip my clothes off in the middle of the
store’</span></i>, as all three Loman men wish to, metaphorically. Willy’s
character is too inadequate to deal with the constant wearying concrete
pressure and judgement of the urban <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘angry glow of orange’</span></i> of the
city in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘greatest country in the world’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Worryingly and revealingly, Ben’s presence
becomes more frequent and takes a greater hold of him as the play continues.
Ben has his own music, which accompanies him, like a sort of associated aura.
One can imagine that it would be in a minor key, haunting and somehow
uncomfortable and difficult to retain in one’s mind, with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘great weight’</span></i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a
certain vicious audacity’</span></i> <a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
It would be simplistic to merely label Willy <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘crazy’</span></i> because
he is becoming increasingly reliant on a phantasm; whether Willy actually
perceives Ben and other characters from the past in the same way they are
portrayed on the stage is irrelevant; Miller states that form was an outgrowth
of his image of the play as the opening of a massive head, revealing the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mass
of contradictions’</span></i> inside. Although Miller claims not to have read
any literature on psychoanalysis prior to having written <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Death of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Salesman</span></i>, it seems that Willy’s
quest and need is to reconcile, or “integrate”, the conflicting sides of his
psyche and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘overcome’</span></i>
his psychoses, in a manner very reminiscent of Jung. Whether he eventually does
this is debatable, because until the last he appeals to Ben, shown by the
continual reference to his name, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Oh, Ben’</span></i>, showing how he
looks up to him as what Willy could have been, had he chosen to try during the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘gold
strikes’</span></i> in Alaska as a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘boy’</span></i>; somehow, by repeatedly
looking to him, he is judging himself by the social criteria that Ben embodies.
Only by justifying his suicide in those terms can he actually go through with
it, and this is perhaps a final failure on Willy’s part. A satisfactory victory
over his own plight would have required a renouncement of Ben by acting against
what Willy would perceive to be those wishes, and behaving as he knows he
should. That might involve a happier ending, perhaps embracing the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘things
that I love in this world’</span></i>, as Biff describes his epiphany: <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘in
the middle of that office building’, ‘I stopped’ ‘and I saw – the sky’</span></i>.
Even at the last, Willy never truly soars, though there is still hope for Biff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Until he can somehow resolve his
own inner conflicts, of which his dreams are merely a symptom, he cannot die
happy. Whether this could ever be possible for one such as Willy is debatable,
but one option from which the play deliberately shies might be for Biff to make
a supreme effort, and for Willy to retire and the family to move away from the
city; this would be an outward demonstration of the renunciation of their
present way of life, symbolically taking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘that phoney dream’</span></i> and
burning it <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘before
something happens’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Despite beginning to realise the
profundity and nature of his own mistakes and troubles, Willy continues to try
to force Biff into making the same ones; even though Happy is more successful
in terms of fitting Willy’s mould, he is dismissed, for both know themselves to
be <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a
dime a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>dozen’</span></i>. Willy
perceives in him the mediocrity that characterises himself, whereas Biff’s
spark captures Willy’s imagination, dashed by Biff’s attempts to rob him of his
treasured illusions, with his painfully honest acceptance of the truth that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I
am not a leader of men, Willy, and neither are you</span></i>’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>There seems something almost
fatalistic about Willy’s plight, about the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mass of tangled roots’</span></i> which
lead to what Miller sees as an inevitable conclusion, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘death of a salesman’</span></i>.
In fact, this idea of an almost inherent, determined truth is represented by
Charley’s two statements, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a salesman is got to dream’</span></i>
and ‘<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>you
don't understand. Willy was a salesman’</span></i>, as though they encompass
explanation within the description <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘salesman’</span></i>. This is quite the
opposite of Miller’s intention to use the play (especially its unique form
crafted for this purpose) to somehow convey the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mobile concurrency of past
and present’</span></i>. To me, it does not seem certain from the first minute
that Willy is going to die. Admittedly, the title (which could merely mean the
spiritual death, or might hint at the shedding of the salesman persona without
actually dying), and Willy’s words, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I'm tired to the death’</span></i>, and
the sense of culmination do hint that Willy is literally at the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘end
of his strength’</span></i>. Interestingly though, one could argue either that
it is his constant dreaming and salesmanship that eventually wears him down, or
that it is his dreaming that sustains him, as shown by Happy’s observation, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Dad
is never so happy as when he’s looking forward to something’</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The sympathy and pity we
undoubtedly feel for Willy is mitigated by intense frustration at the spectacle
we are forced to witness. The play was originally titled <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Inside of his Head</span></i>,
a testament to the extent to which Miller was trying to allow us to understand
Willy; the audience is given special knowledge of Willy, and is able to see
things much more from his perspective than an impartial observer, like another
character in the play, could; without this crucial extra dimension that we
witness, it would be extremely difficult to muster any sort of empathy, and we
would be tempted merely to incomprehendingly pity his plight, which we may or
may not hold him responsible for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Willy’s suicide need not
necessarily be regretted and seen as a terrible tragic disaster. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Willy
Loman did not die in vain’</span></i>. His suicide was also a magnificent
sacrificial gesture, with which he briefly rises above his seemingly small
stature with single-minded decisive determination. This <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘greatness’</span></i>
seems within his reach throughout the play, and yet he seems somehow restrained
by himself and outer pressure from realising it. Finally, he is allowed to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘thankfully
let his burden down’</span></i>, stilling the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘turbulent longings within
him’</span></i>. He tells Linda desperately, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘I’ve gotta overcome it’</span></i>,
and this is his way of doing so, dreamily claiming <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘[Biff]’ll worship me for
it’</span></i>. His insecurity and the issues of which he is most sensitive are
discussed with Ben, who cautions him, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘you don't want to make a fool of
yourself’</span></i>, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘it’s called a cowardly thing, William’</span></i>.
Willy poignantly and frustratedly answers Ben’s accusation of cowardice with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘Why?
Does it take more guts to stand here rest of my life ringing up a zero?’</span></i>
His case is strong that if by dying he can achieve more than living, his action
would be noble in its placing of his family far above himself, as Linda would
see in it: <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he
loved’ ‘his sons’ ‘better than his life’</span></i>. It is tainted by the
gleeful and petty one-upmanship still so much a part of him, as revealed by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘When
the mail comes, he’ll be ahead of Bernard again’</span></i>. This would seem to
indicate that his motives, though not directly furthering himself, are still
concerned with trying to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘conquer the world’</span></i> (or merely
scrabble away from the bottom) by proxy. For the first time in the play, Ben is
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘yielding’</span></i>
<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
conceding <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘that’s
a point’</span></i>, when Willy explains to himself why Biff will not <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘hate’</span></i>
him and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘call
you a coward’</span></i>. This approval or acceptance from Ben is the signal
necessary for Willy to go ahead with his plans. Finally, the dichotomy in his
personality is integrated, as his conscious persona of Willy is in agreement
with Ben, who dictates Willy’s values. He is certain in himself, and is
admirable and dignified in his decisive, contented last action. Interestingly, Willy
doesn't tell his family about his plans, but just goes ahead and carries out
his intention unassumingly; this time, he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘don’t have to tell anyone’</span></i>
because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘he’s
gonna do it’</span></i>. Perhaps, once he loses the capacity to dream, he
cannot be a salesman any longer, and his plight changes; maybe this newfound
rootlessness (also realised by Linda in the Requiem, with her repeated <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘we’re
free’</span></i>) makes his death a necessity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The title assumes that Willy has an
individual plight, and that it is linked to the statement, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a salesman is got to
dream’</span></i>. It begs the question of whether everyone has a plight,
perhaps linked to their defining characteristic. The question is partly asking
whether a salesman’s having to dream is sufficiently plausible as an
explanation for Willy’s plight. Despite the universally human nature of Willy’s
inadequacies and grapplings with his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘boxed in’</span></i> allotment in life,
few of us are affected in quite the same unfortunate and disastrous way as
Willy, even other salesmen (indicating that Willy’s plight cannot be summarised
simply in terms of the title). Even if everyone’s separate plight is different,
could they all have the same root cause? One principal destructive force in
Willy’s life is excess: the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘massive dreams’</span></i> of a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘small
man’</span></i>. Perhaps the opposite, too little, like Charley who regards his
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘salvation’</span></i>
as having <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘never
took any interest in anything’</span></i>, should to be avoided too; though
Charley is preferable to Willy in many ways, there is a detachment about him
that robs him of Willy’s child-like humanity and zeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Biff sighs, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘there is nothing more inspiring or –
beautiful than the sight of a mare and a new colt’</span></i>; these simple,
limited dreams should be enough; they elicit wonderment from Happy, who gushes <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘You’re
a poet, you know that, Biff? You’re a – you’re an idealist’</span></i>. It is
largely Willy’s influence which provides the accompanying, spoiling
dissatisfaction, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘And whenever spring comes to where I am, I suddenly get the
feeling, my God, I’m not gettin' anywhere’</span></i>. Willy too is aiming for
somewhere, but his plight could perhaps been seen as a blind, directionless
striving, for it is the nature of money that no finite quantity once achieved
can ever be enough, for there is always more to be had (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘no man only needs a little
salary’</span></i>). Similarly, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘selling is’</span></i> merely <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘selling’</span></i>,
and nothing more of inherent value (<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘oh it gets to be like everything else’</span></i>).
Seeing it as a goal in itself, a pinnacle, is fatally futile, for though it
inspires dreams, it offers no means of realising them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The play is full of contrasts,
within and between families, fathers and sons, attitudes, youth and age. Miller
serves us these as part of a message that perhaps paths and dreams need not be
the same for everyone; part of Willy’s mistake was foisting his own ambition
upon his champion, Biff (he <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘never worked a day but for your benefit’</span></i>,
seeking <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘reward’</span></i>
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘medals’</span></i>
through Biff’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘bringing home prizes’</span></i>). The challenge in human
relationships is in empathising sufficiently to understand and assist in one
another’s individual plights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Miller has various intentions when
writing the play. He is trying to open up Willy’s head to allow us to see the
writhing <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mass
of contradictions’ ‘inside’</span></i>, as well as writing a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘love
story between a man and his son’</span></i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘in a crazy way’</span></i>,
their country’s creed. However, his creation grows beyond these basic aims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>That <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘a salesman is got to
dream’</span></i> is certainly implicit in the way Willy’s profession is
depicted. The play also analyses what it is that Willy dreams of, and the
dichotomy between his two opposite dreams, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘good dream’</span></i> (of
being <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘number
one man’</span></i>, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘only dream a man can have’</span></i>)
and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘phoney
dream’</span></i> of a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘liar’</span></i> and a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘fake’</span></i>.
The play succeeds by Miller’s own criteria because our uncomfortable proximity
lends intense pathos for Willy, which observers and other characters cannot
fully appreciate. Willy’s plight stems from the multi-causal <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘mass
of tangled roots’</span></i> which are unsatisfactorily summed up by the title
quotation. Besides the problems associated with dreaming and his profession, there
is a long list of partially plausible justifications and reasons which Miller
offers to flesh out the skeletal picture the sense of the script offers:
exhaustion; his absent father; the self-destructive, corrosive “Great American
Dream”; the conflict between his two dreams; his impossible desire to be both
well-liked and successful; his jealousy and mis-directed meagre talents;
burdensomely living his life through his sons; stifled, constricting urban
mundane life; failure, broken dreams and rejections; loneliness; desire to be
simultaneously respected, loved and liked by his sons; his excesses; his
judging criteria and wishes; ageing inability to adapt the traditional to the
modern; his foolishness, pride and insubordination; and his self-deception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>His plight is the combination and
culmination of this multitude of choices and chains that he made for himself
and have come to define him, and everything else that makes up Willy as a
person, outside his actions and inside himself. For this reason, I think that <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The
Inside of His Head</span></i>, the first title for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Death of a Salesman</span></i>
was more apt. His soul is opened up for the audience in such a way that the
layers, aspects and contradictions form the coherent whole of Willy’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>‘disintegrating
personality’</span></i>.</p>
