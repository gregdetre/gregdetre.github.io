<h1>The futility of poetry</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>To the layman, poetry is a useless
device. What purpose does it serve? It does not feed or pay you, so why bother
with it? Yes, without a doubt, poetry is the thoroughly worthless contrivance
of penniless English teachers, pathetically attempting to use words to convey a
subtle, perhaps more poignant meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Poetry is often assigned to that niche
containing museums, works of magnificent and expressive art and similar
insanities of the Renaissance. Can these extravagances ever be appreciated by
everyone? I find it very hard to understand their attraction. Yet, for a select
few, poetry becomes a way of life. <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>A</span>re
these people mad or is their infatuation merely a farce, and their supposedly
emotive and expressive work all a mockery, a lazy and desperate pretence to
make money because manual labour is beneath them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>It seems far more likely that they
truly believe that ecstasy, abject misery and beauty can all be conveyed using
the clumsy tools of language. To the uninitiated the result, poetry, is
incomprehensible and boring but in the right frame of mind it is possible that
the normal inadequacies of prose can be replaced by the concentrated feeling
evoked in a poem. A philistine would answer with the analogy of the ‘Emperor’s
new clothes.’ By this I mean that perhaps nobody reaches this linguistic heaven
when reading poetry, yet everyone is afraid to say so, lest they risk ridicule
and disdain. This situation is changing: our society is no longer the
traditional, strictly conventional orthodoxy it once was. Indeed, rigidity has
been replaced by cynicism and respect is gained by being outspoken. Now, people
are publicly questioning the whole validity of poetry, and artistic expression
in general. The word ‘beauty’ has been ostracised too, and is now no longer an
acceptable description. Perhaps the right of free speech has gone too far, and
too much scepticism is a bad thing. I believe that there will always be a place
for art, or at least for some people. As to whether it is a pointless and
futile exercise in the first place, how is it any more pointless than any of
the other materialistic and superficial gestures we carry out during our tiny
lifespans?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>Maybe this attraction to the
intangible is a subconscious aversion to the mundane and superficial
trivialities with which we are concerned about by necessity. Could it be that
although we realise the fruitlessness of stocks, economies, figures and
advertising, to name just a few examples of the diversions we pursue
relentlessly in aid of fruitless worthless gains, we have no way of breaking
free of their confinement. Perhaps this unwitting revolt is the response to a
pointless, manufactured existence and anybody of any sensitivity would really
prefer not to be subjected to the machinations of an age more concerned with
self-delusion than the production of anything actually worthwhile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>On the other hand, what is the
alternative. I can only think of one truly pure action, spurred on by nothing
but the basest motivations, that of survival. Yet, why bother to live anyway?
To procure further aimless life then die. Why not just die and see what is
next. Survival is ingrained so deeply into the fabric of our existence that we
cannot untangle it. When we are hungry or in pain, we are miserable. Aldous
Huxley’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Brave New World</span></i><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> </span>aired the idea of creating a
person who achieved his greatest feeling of well-being when being whirled
around upside down, because he was indoctrinated that way by oxygen-deprivation
as an embryo. Surely, animal impulses such as attempting to stay alive and
disliking pain could be reversed, and just because we are subject to them does
not mean that they are they best or only way to be. This leads to the point: is
even poetry meaningful, or is it just a simpler and perhaps more easily
justifiable (by being more in line with the sophisticated image we would like
to promote) way of passing the time. People talk of it as being the concentrate
of language, likening it to the fluency and pleasing motion involved in
dancing, yet language is only a crude and restricting method of communication.
Why talk to each other at all? Who cares about the beauty of the stars, or the
simple contentment that some sentimental conformists believe they derive from a
sunny (i.e. bright and uncomfortably hot) day?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'>This all boils down to the
question: why are we here? Assuming this is unfathomable, then should we just
continue, deliberately oblivious to our pointless existence, pretending that
this was what we were meant for, or should we indulge in more advanced
practices, conceivably no less pointless, such as poetry. I don’t believe an
all-encompassing solution will be found, nor do I think anything will change.
However, because of the natural boundaries placed upon us by our voice-boxes
and bodies, until a higher form of communication develops, poetry remains a
more pleasing and effective method of expression than clumsy speech or
strictly-regulated prose.</p>
