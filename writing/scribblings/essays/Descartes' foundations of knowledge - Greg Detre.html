<h1>How secure are the foundations of knowledge in Descartes’<span
style='font-family:&quot;ZapfChan MdIt BT&quot;;font-style:normal'> </span>Meditations?</h1>

<p class=MsoFooter style='margin-top:0cm;tab-stops:18.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Knowledge in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meditations</i> can be taken to mean
‘conclusions of whose validity Descartes feels he can be certain’. There are a
variety of areas of which Descartes believes himself to have attained knowledge
through his meditations: his own existence, and the nature/essence of this
existence; God, and that he exists; error and falsity, and how to avoid them;
and sense perceptions and external reality. The overall knowledge he
establishes is that things are much as they seem, and that a good God exists.
The major foundations for this are his certainty of his self and of the
existence of God. This knowledge is based on a variety of premises and
assumptions which he considers indisputable, but ultimately everything rests
upon his faith in the ratiocinative process, and specifically the ‘natural
light’ by which perceptions’ clarity and distinctness are discerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Although the idea of a malicious
and cunning demon determinedly deceiving him proves an invaluable aid in
forming the habit of questioning everything he perceives, it consequently
renders defunct any conclusions he draws. For, even though he is satisfied that
his certainty of God as the guarantor of the validity of his knowledge allows
him immunity against the wiles of this demon, his proof of the existence of
such a God is subject to the danger of being deceived by the demon. His escape
from this paradox is to attribute a higher strength to the positive understanding
achieved through the natural light than the power of the demon; however, again
he devolves circularly faith in this natural light from the existence of a
deceitless divine being, itself proved using the natural light. Hence, his
recognition of the remote possibility of a deceitful demon to which may be
attributed the power to pervert the course of reason undermines all consequent
rational proof and knowledge, including that which he regards as a failsafe
against this demon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The idea of a natural light seems
at first to disrupt all Descartes’ careful preparations and avowals of rigour.
However, it requires further examination before being wholly dismissed. Terms
like ‘reason’ and ‘logic’ are the intellections which Descartes employs in his
maths and geometry, subjects with whose certainty he is comfortable. It is his
intention to make similar use of this faculty in his philosophising, simply by
altering the focus of his deliberations. However, the process by which he
thinks and reasons is a mystery, and there is no guarantee that even if his
prized certainty can be reached within the restricted, strictly-regulated and
verifiable limits of mathematics and pure abstraction, it may not be accessible
to hazy metaphysical speculation, with its inherent incomprehensibility and
lack of verifiable evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>It becomes apparent that the
‘natural light’ is Descartes’ label for our faculty of judgement, which is our
guide and measure through this conceptual vacuum barren of landmarks. ‘Clarity
and distinctness’ have echoes of Plato’s Simile of the Sun, and Hume’s “force
and liveliness”, all of which are expressions of the power in us to assess a
concept’s verisimilitude. That he still professes to be following his natural
light even when straying from the path of truth would seem to indicate that
when conclusions seem clear and distinct, it may be that they seem so as a
result of being in accordance with our preconceptions. Descartes is aware of
this sense of scepticism about the reliability of the ‘natural light’ as a
guide, which is why he needs to introduce a higher being which embodies and
reveals the truth to us. The fallacies he commits could be ascribed to human
fallibility: through faulty reason, bias or even a political motive. This is a
possibility, given his suspicious piousness, and if true, would rock the
foundations of his work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Meditations</i> begs a discussion of rationalism and its methods, with
regard to the manner of human cognition. It seems evident that despite his
professed method of progressing forward step by reasoned step, Descartes thinks
in a typical, human fashion. By this, I mean that meditative thought is a
deeply mysterious and irrational process, which involves sudden intuitive leaps
forwards which are then semi-automatically rationalised. Descartes was
unwilling to concede that we cannot reason forwards freely and creatively, and
that logical deduction can only be a verification procedure, and that
consequently, the direction our thoughts take is subconscious, as with all
creativity. This explains why his eventual resolutions are so akin to his
preconceived beliefs, and why the natural light can only be a means of
assessing thoughts which have presented themselves to him, rather than a
forward-looking guide mechanism. Interestingly, the natural light would seem to
shine in various directions, judging from the plethora of different systems of
knowledge built by philosophers, all with similar stated aims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm'>As an aside, it is worth noting that
nowhere is Descartes aware of modern questions concerning ‘absolute truth’ and
the implications of existentialism. He can hardly be blamed for this, but a
treatise which attempts to establish anything with <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>complete</i> certainty must at least consider its stance on the most
underlying assumptions we make about the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The first major conclusion that
Descartes reaches in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meditations</i>
is a refined version of his <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cogito</i>
argument used in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Discourses</i>.
However, both are similarly flawed. He uses the statement <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>‘I am, I exist’</i> almost like a mantra, reassuring himself that as
long as he doubts, whatever it might be that he is doubting, his doubt is
absolutely indubitable evidence of his own existence. Indeed, his doubt is
obviously irrefutable evidence that the doubting thoughts exist. From this, it
might then be argued that he is some sort of passive receptacle which records
and is aware of these thoughts, but instead Descartes jumps fallaciously to an
idea of agency, expressed in the first-person ‘I’. He elaborates upon the theme
of the nature of his own existence to describe himself eventually as a
conscious, proactive being, essentially a ‘thinking thing’. He could perhaps
have taken a different, more introspective direction. William James made the
distinction between the ‘I’ that knows the ‘me’. Descartes combines our
consciousness, memories and mental processes into one ‘thinking thing’, when
all he can really be certain of is the existence of thoughts. Moreover, it is
these thoughts that are seemingly possessed of agency, since they spring
unbidden into the chambers of consciousness, and so he is forced to admit the
possibility of subconscious areas of our inner world inaccessible to our
attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The existence of a God as described
in the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Meditations</i> underlies all his
subsequent conclusions, and overall security of his knowledge depends largely
upon the proofs of God he provides. Descartes feels convinced of his proofs of
God, and of their security against public scrutiny. However, despite his
efforts to maintain their incontrovertible veracity, they are open to various
objections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>The first premise is that the
‘cause’ must always be “greater” and more “perfect” than the ‘effect’. This is
a disturbing point from which to begin, since it is by no means indisputable.
This theory that the object of origin must be superior to its product ties in
with his unfounded belief that our ideas stem ultimately from sense experience,
and that any thoughts in our head concerning an object must be inferior to the
object itself, in terms of perfection and reality. Thus, the idea that he
professes to feel most clearly and distinctly of all, that of a being
infinitely superior to himself in every respect, must be a mental echo of just
such a being. This is God, the First Cause which contains everything and from
which all else derives. He believes this idea of God that is so deeply rooted
inside him to be akin to a workman’s mark, the brand by which the created knows
its creator. Although the notion of causes being greater than effects makes
sense intuitively, it is not sufficiently certain for a bedrock premise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>I believe that I too can conceive
of such an infinite being, but without Descartes’ accompanying assumptions, I
am unconvinced of the existence of such a being. It seems rather fanciful to
say that my idea of an infinite being is implanted in me by God, my creator.
However, the idea I have of an infinite being is an intellectual one, produced
by the operation of magnifying and extending the properties of known finite
ideas. Descartes tries to dismiss objections that his God is a negation of
nothing or that He is an extension along a continuum. Yet, we can produce an
idea of the infinite, as we can in mathematics, by comparing ourselves to a
‘lesser’ being, and positively extrapolating <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ad infinitum</i>. Such a God would display the same properties
Descartes describes. He returns later to add that existence must also be a
quality possessed by this being, in order to stave off the objection that this
infinite being may only be real as a concept. Somehow though, it is impossible
to shake oneself of the notion that by attributing the quality of existence to
our conception of such a deity, we are empowering it with reality, although
Descartes tries unconvincingly to explain that this is not what he is
suggesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Strictly, an infinite being is
‘greater’ than us only in terms of degree. Yet Descartes’ God is qualitatively
different somehow: subtly, the distinction between an ‘infinite’ and a
‘perfect’ being has been blurred through misleading terminology. Descartes has
asserted the existence of an infinite being, the First Cause, from which all
else stems. Such a being would be totally inconceivable in human terms, and
would be akin to some sort of pantheistic ‘entity’ or even the universe itself.
Terms such as ‘perfect’, ‘good’, ‘divine’, ‘supreme’ and ‘deceitful’ would have
no meaning with reference to such a being. And yet the divinity that Descartes
envisions is the Christian God in all His glory: an omnipotent, omniscient
anthropomorphic god. Words like ‘good’ and ‘perfect’ connotate human values
straight out of the Bible and are totally inappropriate for an infinite being,
but very necessary as descriptions for a deceitless, loving morally
prescriptive God. For indeed, Descartes appears to have in mind exactly which
direction this is leading in, and what will be necessary for him to have proved
before he can reach his destination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>God’s vital role in Descartes’
entire system of knowledge is as an omnipotent and omniscient being who
guarantees the truth of our beliefs and can be relied upon not to deceive us
(or even permit us to be deceived). This was why it was necessary for Descartes
to have vouchsafed God’s benevolence towards us and His desire to aid us in our
quest for knowledge. This requires another assumption: that deceit is a
‘defect’ and since, in His perfection, God is free of all defects, it follows
that God does not deceive. Descartes stresses that this divine deceitlessness
is not itself a lack, but freedom from a privation. At this point, distinctions
between an infinite amoral being and a Supreme Divinity become most apparent,
since we could expect no such special treatment from an infinite being, who
would be neither deceitful nor deceitless. Only a God would ‘love’ us and seek
to shelter us from falsehood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Having established his newly-proven
God as the guarantor of the soundness of our faculties, Descartes proceeds to
further entrench God in the role of our Protector. His first certainty was of
his own being, but only while his whole attention was focused upon the act of
thinking and thus existing. Now, he is able to provide a surety who conserves
us and cements the permanence of our existence, and answers his own earlier
worry (that he could only be sure of himself while focusing his attention on
the certainty, ‘I am, I exist’), neatly binding the strands of his system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Once God has been established as
the anthropomorphic beneficer that Descartes believes and requires him to be,
there is a need for him to address the evident evils that exist and the flaws
to which we are nevertheless subject. He ascribes this largely to our limited
human understanding being empowered beyond its means by the magnitude of our
will. Some awkward issues external to us as individuals can be dismissed with
the argument that God works with a larger picture that we are too microscopic
to view as a whole, requiring Descartes to prematurely admit the likely
existence of other beings. Where this blind fails or proves insufficient, he
takes recourse behind cunning Christian veils by placing all that is
inexplicable inside a black box, about which a finite being is insufficient to
comprehend. He is thankful for the power of the will within us which gives us
the capability to over-extend ourselves into speculation on matters concerning
which we are prone to error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, he
is simultaneously able to gratefully justify our fallibility and affirm the
natural light as a divine illumination. However, the fact remains that human
nature is characterised by its imperfection, and it is difficult to comprehend
how a God who so favours us has nevertheless ‘cursed’ us in so many respects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Establishing an external reality
populated by corporeal bodies (the objects of our sense perceptions and the
basis of our ideas) is the last task remaining to Descartes. Because he is
unable to devise a means of assuring himself of the conformity between the
reality of the objects and how they appear to him, he adopts his now-standard
stance of trusting in God not to overtly deceive us and endow us with the
ratiocinative might to ward off erroneous beliefs. Therefore this final
foundation, upon which rests the normalcy of our lives, is dependent upon what
has been established earlier regarding God’s defence of us from deceit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:9.0pt'>Despite his repeated pretensions of
modesty, there is a repellent smugness in his manner which belies the
deficiencies in his reasoning. It is a shame that so much of his intellect was
brought to bear on rationalisation and ‘justifying the ways of God to men’<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
Even so, in many ways, Descartes has been successful, at least insofar as he
has contributed to the progress of philosophy. His intention of assembling our
perceived universe rationally is laudable, and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Meditations</i> demonstrates and represents an influential
philosophical approach to this herculean task. However, as Nietzsche showed by
abolishing God, without a rational and moral world order (usually embodied by a
divine figure), we lose all claim on fundamental knowledge. Consequently, the
knowledge Descartes believes he has certified rests insecurely on notions of
his own and God’s nature. Given that he has not satisfied me regarding the
indubitability of these crucial foundations, his concluded knowledge is thus
unfortunately suspect. </p>
