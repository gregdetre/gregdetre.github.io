      <h6>&quot;But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply 
        that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they 
        laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also 
        laughed at Bozo the Clown.&quot; - Carl Sagan</h6>
      <p>Nietzsche could be said to straddle the fine line between genius and 
        insanity. His polemical style occasionally degenerated into ranting, but 
        no one can dispute the imagination and profundity of his ideas. He made 
        no effort to form a coherent system, instead attempting a 'revaluation 
        of values', through an attack on the herd-morality of Christianity, most 
        widely known for his misunderstood notion of the Superman. Described as 
        nihilistic, he could perhaps be better appreciated as promoting a means 
        of existence, 'beyond good and evil', both of which are constructs which 
        become meaningless in a godless world. His death in 1900 after 10 years 
        of madness, probably brought on by the tertiary stages of syphilis, gave 
        his sister and others the chance to abuse and manipulate the wild spirit 
        of his writings by portraying him as the philosophic inspiration behind 
        the Nazi cause.</p>
      <h6>&quot;God is dead: but considering the state Man is in, there will perhaps 
        be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown.&quot; - Nietzsche</h6>
