<h1>BarCamp Tampa - What can neuroscience tell us about learning online?</h1>


<p>Having just moved to Tampa, <a href="http://barcamptampabay.org/">BarCamp Tampa</a> (2013) was a brilliant opportunity to lots of friendly people with interesting things to say. I thoroughly enjoyed myself!</p>
<h2>How to write programs that are right - lessons from science for software engineering</h2>
<p>The title's tongue-in-cheek - it's really about best practices for writing programs where you really care that the answer is right, i.e. youâ€™d rather your program crashes or doesn't finish than that it give you the wrong answer.</p>

<h2>What can neuroscience tell us about learning online?</h2>
<p>My first presentation was right at the beginning of the day - I tried to touch on a dozen ideas from neuroscience/psychology that are relevant to education and learning, especially online learning. The list is of course much longer than this, but I wanted to pick a mix of consequential and counter-intuitive. We had a great discussion, and a couple of people I met there are becoming friends!</p>

<p>[Unfortunately, these slides are very bare-bones and mostly acted as prompts for me - if you're interested in the actual content, drop me a line and I might try and write some of them up as text].</p>
